satisfactory level of contribution to our overall business goals. We also took into account the compensation that is paid by companies that we believe to be our competitors and by other companies
with which we believe we generally compete for executives. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In establishing compensation packages for executive officers, numerous factors are considered,
including the particular executive&#146;s experience, expertise, and performance, our company&#146;s overall performance, and compensation packages available in the marketplace for similar positions. In arriving at amounts for each component of
compensation, our Compensation Committee strives to strike an appropriate balance between base compensation and incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee also endeavors to properly allocate between cash and
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</font> compensation (including without limitation stock and stock option awards) and between annual and long-term compensation. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Employment Agreements </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&#160;15, 2020, we entered
into new <font style="white-space:nowrap">one-year</font> employment agreements with each of John Brda, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Roger Wurtele, our Chief Financial Officer. Their previous employment agreements expired in June
2020. Under the new agreements, Messrs. Brda and Wurtele will continue to receive their same annual salaries of $375,000 and $225,000, with 36% and 20% of the salaries, respectively, continuing to accrue unpaid until such time as the Board of
Directors believes there is adequate cash for such payment, or as otherwise contemplated in the employment agreement. Each individual will be eligible for a bonus at the Compensation Committee&#146;s discretion. Each agreement provides that if there
is a &#147;change of control&#148; in the company (as defined in the agreement), the employee will be paid in one lump sum any amounts owed to the employee under the agreement that are accrued and unpaid plus his salary that would be earned through
the end of the term of the agreement. Each employment agreement has a covenant not to compete and provides for expense reimbursement, four weeks of vacation and certain other benefits. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, as part of their employment compensation, the Compensation Committee granted Mr.&#160;Brda an option to purchase a total of up to 2,250,000
shares of common stock, including up to 375,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share and up to 1,875,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, and granted Mr.&#160;Wurtele an option to purchase a total of up to 750,000 shares of
common stock, including up to 375,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share and up to 375,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The options were granted under our Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Option Plan. The options of
both executives will vest upon either (a)&#160;the approval by shareholders of a change of control occurring prior to July&#160;15, 2021, or (b)&#160;the company entering into a letter of intent with a third party prior to July&#160;15, 2021 that
contemplates a change of control, and the change of control transaction closes with that third party (or an affiliate(s) of that third party) at a date not later than July&#160;15, 2022; subject, however, to acceleration and earlier vesting of all
of the options in the event of (i)&#160;the termination of employment by the employee for &#147;good reason&#148; under his employment agreement or (ii)&#160;a determination of the Compensation Committee, at its discretion. In the event of the death
or disability of the employee prior to vesting or if the company terminates the employee&#146;s employment for reasons other than for &#147;cause&#148; under the employment agreement prior to vesting, the option will still vest upon the occurrence
of the events described under clauses (a)&#160;or (b) above. The options, to the extent such options have not been exercised, will terminate and become null and void on July&#160;15, 2025, if and only if the options vest as described above, or on
July&#160;15, 2021, if the options do not vest as described above, subject to the occurrence of the events contemplated under clause (b)&#160;above whereby the options would not terminate until July&#160;15, 2022. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors adopted our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2021 Plan&#148;) on October&#160;28, 2021. The stockholders are being
asked to approve the 2021 Plan, a copy of which is set forth in this proxy statement as <u>Appendix A</u>. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&#160;14, 2020, we,
Meta Materials Inc. (formerly known as Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.), and our subsidiaries entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the &#147;Arrangement Agreement&#148;) with Metamaterial Inc., an Ontario corporation headquartered in Nova
Scotia, Canada (&#147;Meta&#148;) to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Meta by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the &#147;Arrangement&#148;) under the<i></i><i>&#160;Business Corporations Act</i>&#160;(Ontario), on and subject
to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement.&#160;On June&#160;28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement was completed. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Arrangement, on June&#160;25, 2021, we effected a reverse stock split of our Common Stock, at a ratio <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">of&#160;two-to-one&#160;(the</font></font> &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;), and changed our name from &#147;Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.&#148; to &#147;Meta Materials Inc.&#148;. The
shares of our Common Stock, previously traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) through the close of business on June&#160;25, 2021 under the ticker symbol &#147;TRCH,&#148; commenced trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol
&#147;MMAT&#148; on June&#160;28, 2021. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Arrangement, we assumed the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan of
Metamaterial, Inc. (the &#147;Meta Plan&#148;) which, after the closing of the Arrangement, had 6,445,745 shares remaining in its pool for future grants and issuances. At the closing of the Arrangement, we also had 3,500,000 shares in our 2015 Stock
Option Plan (the &#147;Torchlight Plan&#148;). The Meta Plan and Torchlight Plan are referred to herein as our &#147;Prior Plans.&#148; </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The size of the share reserve (the &#147;Pool&#148;) for the 2021 Plan will be 34,945,745 shares, which number is (i) 3,500,000 shares
remaining eligible for grants in the Torchlight Plan as of October&#160;25, 2021, (ii) the 6,445,745 shares remaining eligible for grants in the Meta Plan that we assumed in the Arrangement as of October&#160;25, 2021, and (iii) 25,000,000
additional shares. The stockholders are being asked to approve the 2021 Plan so that we may use our 2021 Plan to retain and attract the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentives to our
employees, directors and consultants and to promote the success of our business. If stockholders approve the 2021 Plan, then the Pool will be available for issuance to our employees, directors and our service providers. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The 2021 Plan Will Allow Us to Retain and to Continue Attracting and Retaining the Best Talent </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors believe that our success depends on the ability to attract and retain the best available personnel and that the ability
to grant equity awards is crucial to recruiting and retaining the services of such individuals. In addition, our board of directors believes that equity awards align the interests of service providers and stockholders by giving service providers an
ownership stake in the company, motivate service providers to achieve outstanding performance, and provide an effective means of rewarding service providers for their contributions to our success. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If stockholders approve the 2021 Plan, then the Pool would be available to be issued to our service providers. If stockholders do not approve
the 2021 Plan, the we would continue to grant equity awards to our employees and service providers under our Prior Plans, but we will be limited to 9,955,745 shares which our board of directors feels will not be sufficient to adequately incentivize
our current employees and service providers or for our future growth. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the above, it would be challenging to attract and
retain talent. Furthermore, we will be unable to continue our equity incentive program and we will have to restructure our existing compensation programs for </p>

reasons that are not directly related to the achievement of our business objectives, which could prevent us from successfully attracting and retaining highly skilled executive officers and other
service providers. To remain competitive without equity-based compensation arrangements, it likely will be necessary to replace components of compensation previously awarded in equity with cash. We do not believe increasing cash compensation to make
up for any shortfall in equity compensation would be practical or advisable, because we believe that a combination of equity awards and cash compensation provide a more effective compensation strategy than cash alone for attracting, retaining and
motivating our employees long-term and aligning employees&#146; and stockholders&#146; interests. In addition, any significant increase in cash compensation in lieu of equity awards could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce our
cash flow from operations, which could adversely affect our business results and could adversely affect our business strategy, including using cash flow for strategic acquisitions, research and development of innovative new products, and
improvements in the quality and performance of existing products. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>A Reasonable Number of Shares Will Be Reserved Under the 2021 Plan </i></b></p>

under the 2021 Plan, which is an increase from 9,955,745 shares currently reserved under the Prior Plans. If the 2021 Plan is approved by the stockholders, we anticipate that these shares of our common stock will be enough to meet our expected needs
for approximately 3 years. The compensation committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, and our board of directors considered the following when determining the number of shares to reserve for issuance under the 2021

pursuant to either of our Prior Plans expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, is forfeited to or repurchased by us due to the failure to vest, the unpurchased shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock
appreciation rights the forfeited or repurchased shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the 2021 Plan (unless the 2021 Plan has terminated), provided that no more than 27,968,944 shares may become

stated above, plus, to the extent allowable under Code Section&#160;422 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any shares that become available for issuance under the 2021 Plan in accordance with the foregoing. The stockholders are

(unless the 2021 Plan has terminated). Shares that have actually been issued under the 2021 Plan under any award will not be returned to the 2021 Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the 2021 Plan. However, if shares
issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock or, restricted stock units, performance shares or performance units are repurchased by us or are forfeited to us due to the failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant under the
2021 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholdings related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the 2021 Plan. To the extent an award under the 2021 Plan is paid out in cash
rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Plan

participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered or cancelled in
exchange for awards of the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price or different terms, awards of a different type or cash, or by which the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrator&#146;s

the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the administrator, as well as
other types of consideration permitted by applicable law. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their option for the period of time stated in their option agreement. In the absence of a specified
time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for twelve months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the option will remain exercisable for
three months following the termination of service. An option may not be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of options. </p>

appreciation rights may be granted under our 2021 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights
may not have a term exceeding ten years. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their stock appreciation right for the period of time stated in their stock appreciation rights agreement. In the
absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for twelve months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement,
the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of our
2021 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof,
except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. </p>

restricted stock granted to any employee, director or consultant and, subject to the provisions of our 2021 Plan, will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be
appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which
any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of

result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish performance objectives or other vesting criteria in its discretion, which,
depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or the value of performance units and performance shares to be paid out to participants. The administrator may set performance objectives based on the achievement of
company-wide, divisional, business unit or individual goals (including continued employment or service), applicable federal or state securities laws or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. After the grant of a

to $1,500,000 in connection with the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</font> director&#146;s initial service. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance

thereof) are not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger or change in control, the participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of their outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, including shares as to which
such awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock and RSUs will lapse and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at
100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement between the participant and us or any of our subsidiaries or parents,
as applicable. If an option or stock appreciation right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or change in control, the administrator will notify the participant in writing or electronically that the option or stock appreciation
right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator in its sole discretion and the vested option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. </p>

summary is intended only as a general guide to the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2021 Plan. The summary is based on existing U.S. laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that those laws and
regulations will not change in the future. The summary does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax consequences upon a participant&#146;s death, or the provisions of the income tax laws of any municipality, state or <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> country in which the participant may reside. As a result, tax consequences for any particular participant may vary based on individual circumstances. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Incentive Stock Options </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An optionee
recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax purposes as a result of the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option qualifying under Section&#160;422 of the Code. Optionees who neither dispose of their shares within two (2)&#160;years
following the date the option was granted nor within one (1)&#160;year following the exercise of the option normally will recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares.
If an optionee satisfies such holding periods upon a sale of the shares, the Company will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. If an optionee disposes of shares within two (2)&#160;years after the date of grant or within
one (1)&#160;year after the date of exercise (a &#147;disqualifying disposition&#148;), the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date and the option exercise price (not to exceed the gain realized on the sale if the
disposition is a transaction with respect to which a loss, if sustained, would be recognized) will be taxed as ordinary income at the time of disposition. Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain. If a loss is recognized, there will
be no ordinary income, and such loss will be a capital loss. Any ordinary income recognized by the optionee upon the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, except to the
extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The difference between the option exercise price and the fair
market value of the shares on the exercise date is treated as an adjustment in computing the optionee&#146;s alternative minimum taxable income and may be subject to an alternative minimum tax which is paid if such tax exceeds the regular tax for
the year. Special rules may apply with respect to certain subsequent sales of the shares in a disqualifying disposition, certain basis adjustments for purposes of computing the alternative minimum taxable income on a subsequent sale of the shares
and certain tax credits which may arise with respect to optionees subject to the alternative minimum tax. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Nonstatutory Stock Options </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Options not designated or qualifying as incentive stock options will be nonstatutory stock options having no special U.S. tax status. An
optionee generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant of such an option. Upon exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, the optionee normally recognizes ordinary income equal to the amount that the fair market value of the shares
on such date exceeds the exercise price. If the optionee is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of stock acquired by the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, any
gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date, will be taxed as capital gain or loss. No tax deduction is available to the Company with respect to the grant of a nonstatutory stock option
or the sale of the stock acquired pursuant to such grant. </p>

generally will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of any shares of our common stock received. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment
taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Restricted Stock Awards </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A participant acquiring restricted stock generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting
date. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. The participant may elect, pursuant to Section&#160;83(b) of the Code, to accelerate the ordinary income tax event to
the date of acquisition by filing an election with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30)&#160;days after the date the shares are acquired. Upon the sale of shares acquired pursuant to a restricted stock award, any gain or loss,
based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event occurs, will be taxed as capital gain or loss. </p>

stock units generally will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of shares issued to such participant at the end of the applicable vesting period or, if later, the settlement date elected by the
administrator or a participant. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of any shares received
would be capital gain or loss. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Performance Shares and Performance Unit Awards </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A participant generally will recognize no income upon the grant of a performance share or a performance unit award. Upon the settlement of such
awards, participants normally will recognize ordinary income in the year of receipt in an amount equal to the cash received and the fair market value of any cash or nonrestricted shares received. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary
income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of any shares received, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event
occurs, will be taxed as capital gain or loss. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Section&#160;409A </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&#160;409A of the Code provides certain requirements for <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-qualified</font> deferred compensation
arrangements with respect to an individual&#146;s deferral and distribution elections and permissible distribution events. Awards granted under the 2021 Plan with a deferral feature will be subject to the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the
Code. If an award is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code, the recipient of that award may recognize ordinary income on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to
when the compensation is actually or constructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section&#160;409A fails to comply with Section&#160;409A&#146;s provisions, Section&#160;409A imposes an additional 20% federal income tax on
compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as interest on such deferred compensation. Certain states have enacted laws similar to Section&#160;409A which impose additional taxes, interest and penalties on
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-qualified</font> deferred compensation arrangements. The Company will also have withholding and reporting requirements with respect to such amounts. </p>
