<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of six members, five of whom are
Independent Directors. The Board elects the Company&#146;s officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly valuation of the Company&#146;s assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of
the Company&#146;s financing arrangements and oversight of its investment activities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board&#146;s role in the management of the
Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company&#146;s investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GSAM as part of its day-to-day management of the Company&#146;s investment activities. The Board
reviews risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GSAM as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or
presentations. The goal of the Board&#146;s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with the Company&#146;s investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. Stockholders
should note, however, that the Board&#146;s oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company&#146;s investments. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has established an Audit Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee and Contract
Review Committee. The scope of each committee&#146;s responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ashok N. Bakhru, an
Independent Director, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Stockholders for Mr.&#160;Bakhru to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company&#146;s portfolio companies, his broad
experience with the day-to-day management and operation of other investment funds and his significant background in the financial services industry, as described above. Mr.&#160;Bakhru will generally act as a liaison between management, officers and
attorneys between meetings of the Board and preside over all executive sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility
among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and
interaction between management and the Board. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board had 10 formal meetings in 2016. Each nominee and continuing director that was a
member of the Board during the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2016 attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees on which he or she served. To promote effectiveness of the Board,
directors are strongly encouraged to attend regularly scheduled Board meetings in person. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

it also considers any conflicts of interest brought to its attention pursuant to the Company&#146;s Code of Ethics. Each of the Company&#146;s directors and executive officers is instructed and periodically reminded to inform GSAM Compliance of any
potential related party transactions. In addition, each such director and executive officer completes a questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information about any potential related party transactions. </p>
