<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of five members, four of whom are
Independent Directors. The Board elects the Company&#146;s officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly valuation of the Company&#146;s assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of
the Company&#146;s financing arrangements and oversight of its investment activities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board&#146;s role in the management of the
Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company&#146;s investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GSAM as part of its
<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</font></font> management of the Company&#146;s investment activities. The Board reviews risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the
year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GSAM as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board&#146;s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks
associated with the Company&#146;s investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. Stockholders should note, however, that the Board&#146;s oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure
that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company&#146;s investments. The Board also has primary responsibility for the valuation of the Company&#146;s assets. </p>

Committee, Compliance Committee and Contract Review Committee. The scope of each committee&#146;s responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Jaime Ardila, an Independent Director, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the
Stockholders for Mr.&#160;Ardila to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company&#146;s portfolio companies, his broad corporate background and experience with financial and investment matters and his significant senior management
experience, as described above. Mr.&#160;Ardila generally acts as a liaison between management, officers and attorneys between meetings of the Board and presides over all executive sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board
believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size
creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management and the Board. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board had nine formal meetings in 2018. Each continuing director that was a member of the Board during the fiscal year ended
December&#160;31, 2018 attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees during the periods that he or she served. To promote effectiveness of the Board, directors are strongly encouraged to
attend regularly scheduled Board meetings in person. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">None of the Company&#146;s directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of

whom is an Independent Director. Mr.&#160;Ardila simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, and the Board has determined that his simultaneous service on the audit committees of other public companies does not
impair his ability to effectively serve on the Audit Committee. Mr.&#160;Kari serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee have determined that Mr.&#160;Kari is an &#147;audit committee financial expert,&#148; as
defined in Item 407 of Regulation <font style="white-space:nowrap">S-K.</font> </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing matters

services provided by the independent public accountants. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily
available. The Audit Committee&#146;s charter is available on the Company&#146;s website (<i><u>https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com</u></i>). </p>

requirements and have the capacity to address financial and legal issues and exercise reasonable business judgment. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers a variety of criteria in evaluating candidates (including candidates nominated by a
Stockholder), including (1)&#160;experience in business, financial or investment matters or in other fields of endeavor; (2)&#160;financial literacy and/or whether he or she is an &#147;audit committee financial expert,&#148; as defined in Item 407

provide that for any nomination to be properly brought by a Stockholder for a meeting, such Stockholder must comply with advance notice requirements and provide the Company with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a Stockholder&#146;s
notice must be received at the Company&#146;s principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of Stockholders. The Company&#146;s bylaws further
provide that nominations of persons for election to the Board at a special meeting may be made only by or at the direction of the Board and, provided that the Board has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a Stockholder who
is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee&#146;s charter is available on the Company&#146;s website

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee has: (a)&#160;reviewed and discussed the Audited Financial Statements with the management of the Company;
(b)&#160;discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;); and
(c)&#160;received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 regarding the independent auditor&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee

basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and
regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee&#146;s considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Company&#146;s financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on its
