<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is expected that the solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail. The Company&#146;s officers, and personnel of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, L.P. (the &#147;Investment Adviser&#148;), the Company&#146;s Investment Adviser and transfer agent and any authorized proxy solicitation agent, may also solicit proxies by telephone, email, facsimile, or Internet. If the Company records
votes through the Internet or by telephone, it will use procedures designed to authenticate Stockholders&#146; identities to allow Stockholders to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions and to confirm that their
identities have been properly recorded. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company will pay the expenses associated with this Proxy Statement and solicitation, in a

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any person giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised (1)&#160;by notifying the Secretary of the Company in writing at

II, a Delaware limited liability company, into Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. II, a Delaware corporation. As a result, any references in this section to meetings of the Company&#146;s Board prior to November&#160;23, 2021 refer to
meetings of the Company&#146;s LLC predecessor. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business and affairs are managed under the direction of its Board. The
Board consists of six members, five of whom are Independent Directors. &#147;Independent Directors&#148; are directors who (1)&#160;are not deemed to be &#147;interested persons,&#148; of the Company (as defined in the Investment Company Act), (2)
meet the definition of &#147;independent directors&#148; under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE and (3)&#160;meet the independence requirements of Section&#160;10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act. The Board elects our officers, who serve at
the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include oversight of the quarterly valuation of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board&#146;s role in the management of the Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company&#146;s investment activities extends to
oversight of the risk management processes employed by the Investment Adviser as part of <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">its&#160;day-to-day</font></font> management of our investment activities. The Board reviews
risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of the Investment Adviser as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or

presentations. The goal of the Board&#146;s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with the Company&#146;s investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly
investigated and responsibly addressed. The Board&#146;s oversight function cannot, however, eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company&#146;s investments. The Board also has primary
responsibility for the valuation of the Company&#146;s assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has established an Audit Committee, Governance and Nominating
Committee (the &#147;Governance and Nominating Committee&#148;), Compliance Committee (the &#147;Compliance Committee&#148;), and Contract Review Committee (the &#147;Contract Review Committee&#148;). The scope of each committee&#146;s
responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Timothy J. Leach, an Independent Director, serves as Chairperson of the Board. The
Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company for Mr.&#160;Leach to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company&#146;s portfolio companies, his broad corporate background and experience with financial and investment
matters and his significant senior management experience, as described above. Mr.&#160;Leach generally acts as a liaison between the Company&#146;s management, officers and attorneys between meetings of the Board and presides over all executive
sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that
enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management and the Board. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board had five formal meetings in 2021. Each director nominee that was a member of the Board during the fiscal year ended
December&#160;31, 2021 attended 100% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees on which he or she served. To promote effectiveness of the Board, directors are strongly encouraged to attend regularly scheduled
Board meetings in person. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Committees of the Board of Directors </b></p>

Chairperson of the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee have determined that Richard A. Mark is an &#147;audit committee financial expert,&#148; as defined in Item 407 of
<font style="white-space:nowrap">Regulation&#160;S-K&#160;under</font> the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing matters relating to the appointment and activities of the Company&#146;s auditors, audit plans and procedures,
various accounting and financial reporting issues and changes in accounting policies, and reviewing the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by the Company&#146;s independent public accountants. The Audit Committee is also

Directors for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company, the work of the Company&#146;s independent auditors, and the work of the internal auditors relating to the Company. The Board, with the
assistance of the Committee, shall determine whether any member of the Committee is an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; (&#147;ACFE&#148;) as defined by the applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
