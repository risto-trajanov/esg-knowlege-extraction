0":0,"text":"Investors are Flying Blind as over 70% of reviewed companies and 80% of auditors fail to disclose climate-related risks in the financials\n\nThis report examines whether 107 publicly-listed carbon-intensive firms (and their auditors) considered material climate-related risks in financial reporting. At the same time the study also assesses whether investor concerns about Paris-alignment of assumptions and estimates have been addressed. The study covered a range of sectors: 33% Oil and Gas, 17% Transportation, 13% Utilities, 7% Cement, 7% Consumer Goods and Services, and 23% Other industrials (including mining, chemicals and steel).\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 global accounting[2] and auditing standard-setters clarified that material climate-related risks should not be ignored in accounts or in audits. Another concern raised by the report is the lack of consistency across company reporting. 72% of companies showed no evidence of follow through from other discussions of climate risks or emissions targets to their treatment in the financial statements, or explained any differences.\n\nDespite significant financial risks faced from the climate crisis, and net-zero pledges made by many we found little evidence that companies or their auditors considered climate-related matters in the 2020 financial statements.\n\nFigure 1: Overall results – considerations of climate matters in financial statements and audit reports\n\nSource: Carbon Tracker and CAP team analyses\n\nCompared to other sectors profiled, oil and gas companies provided the most evidence of, and transparency around, consideration of climate-related matters in their financials and audit reports. These companies were the most visible in terms of providing\/detailing the assumptions used, even if they did not always consider climate in those assumptions, nor align them with preferred Paris outcomes.\n\nFigure 2: Consistency in considering climate targets – O & G companies\n\nSource: Carbon Tracker analysis and

We, the shareholders, must protect our assets against devastating climate change, and we therefore support companies to substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company to set and publish medium- and long-term targets to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Company’s\noperations and energy products (Scope 1, 2, and 3) consistent with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement: to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.\nYou have our support.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:\nThe policies of energy companies—the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters—are crucial to confronting the climate crisis. Therefore shareholders support oil and gas companies to substantially reduce their emissions.\nWe, the shareholders, understand this support to be essential in protecting all our assets in the global economy from devastating climate change.\nWe therefore support the Company to set emission reduction targets for all emissions: the emissions of the company’s operations and the emissions of its energy products (Scope 1, 2, and 3). Reducing Scope 3 emissions, the vast majority, is essential to limiting global heating.\nScientific consensus\nThe world’s leading international scientific bodies recently released reports which clearly state the need for deep cuts in emissions in order to limit global warming to safe levels.\nFinancial momentum\nA growing international consensus has emerged among financial institutions that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.\nBacking from investors that insist on targets for all emissions continues to gain momentum: 2021 saw unprecedented investor support for climate resolutions. In the US, three of these climate resolutions passed with a historic majority. In Europe, support for these climate resolutions continued to build.\nLegal risk\nIn 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to severely reduce their worldwide emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 2030. This indicates that oil majors and large investors have an individual legal responsibility to combat dangerous climate change by reducing emissions and confirms the risk of liability.\nWe believe that the Company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with curbing climate change.\nYou have our support.\nBoard of directors’ response\nYour Board shares the interest of Chevron’s investors and stakeholders in addressing climate change and the role of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as a contributor to climate change. We are also mindful that the journey to a lower carbon future will still require oil and gas, particularly in areas where there are currently no effective substitutes, such as shipping and transportation.\nAn honest conversation\nClimate change is a challenge for all of us, and we need to address it holistically. Chevron is committed to an honest conversation about the energy transition. We could reduce our GHG emissions by changing our portfolio and selling our emissions-producing assets, but that would not serve our stockholders, who benefit from our strong asset base. Moreover, it would not benefit the global effort to combat climate change if we were to sell such assets to another company, who would still operate the assets, but perhaps to a less carbon-efficient standard.\nWe have addressed Scope 3 with our Portfolio Carbon Intensity metric\nWe have heard our stockholders’ requests for relevant and comparable data to allow them to evaluate how we are performing on GHG management compared to others in our industry. Chevron has developed the Portfolio Carbon Intensity (“PCI”) methodology, which we believe addresses the interests of stakeholders wanting comparable metrics that address Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions. PCI covers the full value chain emissions of our products, from production to use by customers. PCI is transparent and replicable by leveraging information readily found in financial statements, emissions disclosures, and emission factors. We encourage you to learn more about PCI in our 2021 Climate Change Resilience Report, and we invite you to explore the PCI tool on www.chevron.com.\nAccountability\nYour Board is holding Chevron accountable by endorsing PCI reduction targets. Chevron intends to reach these goals through innovation and top-tier performance. As part of this, and as you will see from our support of Proxy Item 7, Chevron is committed to detecting and mitigating methane emissions. We ask that you support Chevron’s efforts and allow us to demonstrate that Chevron’s GHG reduction ambitions and metrics are a sound strategy for stockholders and for addressing climate change.\nTherefore, your Board recommends that you vote against this proposal."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-26T16:30:12.140513Z","updated_at":"2023-04-29T03:11:09.834720Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15,"annotations":[{"id":4,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":180,"end":201,"text":"climate-related

In 2019 and 2020, global and U.S. accounting and auditing standard-setters reiterated that material climate-related risks should be accounted for in company financial statements and audits.1,2,3 Major investor groups, representing assets worth over $103 trillion, have also called on companies and auditors to fully reflect climate risks to companies’ financial results and position.4\nThese concerns reflect a converging consensus by policymakers, investors, and companies on growing climate risk, the need to limit global temperature increase to 1.5° C (net zero global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050),5 and the impact of such actions to companies.\nThe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero Scenario describes an energy sector pathway to achieve net zero emissions. The Scenario finds that no new investment in fossil supply projects is needed, and anticipates oil prices dropping as low as $36\/ barrel in 2030 and $24\/ barrel in 2050.6\nGiven these global climate imperatives, to best allocate investments, investors are calling for information to assess the financial impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks on companies and identify companies best positioned to thrive in a low carbon economy. Yet, more than 70% of listed companies, representing some of the world’s largest carbon-polluters, are not fully accounting for climate-related risks in their financial statements.7\nChevron continues to develop new fossil fuel resources while acknowledging climate related risks8 that could lead to increased future impairments. Despite the materiality of this\nissue, Chevron’s audited annual disclosures do not currently provide investors with sufficient insight into assumptions used to assess productive assets for impairment and stranded asset risk. Further, an independent 2021 analysis concluded that Chevron’s financial statements lack the requisite transparency about climate-related assumptions and estimates, and that the company does not appear to use Paris-aligned assumptions and estimates.9\nIn contrast, peers (Shell, bp, TotalEnergies) have released more transparent disclosures in their audited financial statements, articulating the extent of consideration of climate change contingencies and risks.10\nAccurate accounting assists investors in understanding the drivers of risk and return. Investors seek additional information from Chevron to understand the impact of climate-related factors on its business model and current financial reporting.\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request Chevron’s Board of Directors provide an audited report addressing how application of the assumptions of the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 pathway would affect the assumptions and estimates underlying its financial statements, including its long-term commodity and carbon prices, remaining asset lives, existing and future asset retirement obligations, capital expenditures, and asset valuations (impairments). The report should be produced at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:\nProponents recommend the report be supported with reasonable assurance from an independent auditor.\nBoard of directors’ response\nYour Board appreciates the focus of our investors and stakeholders on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Chevron supports the goals of the Paris Agreement and is committed to lowering our portfolio carbon intensity, on a full-cycle basis, and to being transparent about our progress.\nWe have substantially addressed the request\nChevron received a similar proposal last year, seeking an audited report on how the energy sector pathway hypothesized in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario (NZE 2050) would affect Chevron’s financial position and underlying assumptions. Subsequent to that proposal, we tested our portfolio using NZE 2050 demand and commodity price projections. We reported on the results of this scenario test in our updated Climate Change Resilience Report in October 2021. That report discusses how our portfolio would fare from a financial viability perspective and also the changes we would need to make under the NZE 2050 assumptions. Chevron’s Corporate Audit department, which performs the internal audit function at Chevron, conducted a non-rated assurance review of the NZE 2050 scenario analysis, and determined that the analysis was conducted in accordance with established internal process and emerging external guidance.\nWe report in accordance with established standards\nWe regularly analyze alternative scenarios to stress-test our portfolio, and we integrate those learnings to help us remain competitive and resilient in any environment. This information is confidential and competitively sensitive. We do not report audited outcomes on these scenarios. Rather, we report and disclose in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. With this oversight framework, our strategic plans reflect management’s best assessment of the longer-term outlook on supply, demand and commodity prices and its judgment in deploying the Company’s strategy in that environment. We consider the likelihood of the IEA’s NZE 2050 scenario to be remote and do not rely on the NZE 2050 scenario for our business planning. Your Board believes it would not be a responsible use of Company resources to produce a further report to address a speculative scenario, as the Proposal requests.\nTherefore, your Board recommends that you vote against this proposal."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-26T16:30:12.140667Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T16:22:51.957976Z","inner_id":15,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
