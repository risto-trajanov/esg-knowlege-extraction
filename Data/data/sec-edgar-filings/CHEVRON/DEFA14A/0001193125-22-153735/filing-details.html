to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this presentation. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and
natural gas prices and demand for the company's products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other
producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics (including coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any related government
policies and actions; disruptions in the company's global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the costs of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which
the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russian and Ukraine and the global response to&#160;such conflict; changing refining, marketing and chemicals
margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results
of operations and financial condition of the company&#8217;s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s joint-venture partners to fund their share of
operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned
projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company&#8217;s
control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental
statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the
company&#8217;s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government
mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; material reductions in
corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to implement capital allocation strategies, including future stock repurchase programs and dividend payments; the effects of changed accounting rules under
generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company&#8217;s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading
&#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 20 through 25 of the company&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this
presentation could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. As used in this presentation, the term &#8220;Chevron&#8221; and such terms as &#8220;the company,&#8221; &#8220;the corporation,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221;

Primary filer Board recommendation highlights and additional Chevron views Item 5: Adopt medium- and long-term GHG reduction targets Follow This AGAINST: Chevron has set: (1) various GHG intensity targets through 2028; (2) a net zero aspiration by
2050 for Upstream Scope 1 and 2*; and (3) a Portfolio Carbon Intensity (PCI) reduction target that covers Scopes 1, 2 and certain 3 emissions. The proposal does not simply ask for more disclosure, but instead requests prescriptive, absolute targets
that seek to change Chevron&#8217;s strategy and significantly reduce, or even eliminate, Chevron&#8217;s core business. Absolute emission targets are incompatible with our strategy that is focused on delivering higher returns, lower carbon by
increasing our oil and gas production while lowering carbon intensity and providing lower carbon solutions for hard-to-abate sectors. We believe that the targets that Chevron has set, described above, support our strategic vision of delivering lower
carbon energy to a growing world. Item 6: Report on Impacts of Net Zero 2050 Scenario As You Sow on behalf of Curtis Overway and Marcelina Cravat-Overway AGAINST: Chevron&#8217;s October 2021 Climate Change Resilience Report includes a detailed
analysis of IEA&#8217;s Net Zero 2050 scenario and substantially addresses the request. In our stockholder engagements, stockholders provided positive feedback about our October 2021 disclosure. While it can be a useful stress test, we do not use
the hypothetical IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario for our business planning, and therefore do not think an audit is warranted. The request for a formal &#8216;audit&#8217; of a hypothetical scenario, for which there is not an established auditing
practice, would not add any meaningful information to our existing scenario analysis disclosure in our October 2021 TCFD-aligned report. Item 7: Report on Reliability of Methane Emission Disclosures Mercy Investment Services, Inc. FOR: Chevron is
committed to advancing the accuracy and reliability of methane emission reporting and plans to release a Methane Strategy Update later this year addressing methane detection, direct measurement quantification, and disclosure. *Accomplishing this
aspiration depends on continuing progress on commercially viable technology; government policy; successful negotiations for CCS and nature-based projects; availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market; and granting of
necessary permits by governing authorities.</font></p>

(con&#8217;t) Proposal Primary filer Board recommendation highlights and additional Chevron views Item 8: Report on Business with Conflict-Complicit Governments International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund AGAINST: The proposal is focused on
Myanmar. In January 2022, Chevron released a statement announcing our intention to exit Myanmar. Also, we believe that Chevron has the right processes and governance in place to ensure that we make the right decisions about where and how we conduct
our business. Item 9: Report on Racial Equity Audit The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia AGAINST: Chevron is committed to addressing racial injustice and has extensive disclosures and actions in support of racial equity. Chevron already
provides robust disclosure on key racial equity issues such as DE&amp;I, human rights, and community engagement. It is unclear what additional information a formal &#8216;audit&#8217;, which likewise lacks established practices within
Chevron&#8217;s sector, would add to the mix of information available to investors. Chevron&#8217;s Board is actively overseeing these issues, providing an appropriate level of independent oversight. In addition, Chevron regularly engages with third
parties &#8211; including stockholders, employee groups, community groups, and other stakeholders &#8211; to collect their input on key ESG issues. Item 10: Special Meetings Newground Social Investment on behalf of Dr. Eric Rehm AGAINST: We believe
Chevron&#8217;s existing special meeting rules and current 15% threshold are appropriate. Chevron already provides stockholders owning 15% of outstanding common stock with the right to call a special meeting, which helps avoid waste of company and
stockholder resources to address narrow or special interests. For these reasons, we recommend that stockholders vote &#8220;AGAINST&#8221; Items 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. </font></p>
