and perspectives on our Company. This webcast is an important part of our broader shareholder outreach, which occurs throughout the year. But first, let me take a moment to express our sincere appreciation for the efforts of first responders,
medical &#183; professionals, and essential services workers around the world who are helping to manage the effects of the pandemic. Our thoughts are with all those personally effected by COVID-19. From all of us at ExxonMobil, we are proud to
assist where we can and we are committed to providing the energy that is essential for economic recovery worldwide. Over the next hour we will cover two main topics. First, Inge Van Coppenolle, Manager, Compensation, Benefits and &#183; Policies
will cover key highlights of ExxonMobil&#8217;s executive compensation program. Second, I will review the six shareholder proposals for vote in our proxy statement. We know you might be engaging with numerous companies during this time of the year
so we thank you for taking the time &#183; to join us this morning. We will leave time today at the end of our prepared remarks for questions. Please feel free to submit your questions on the &#183; content of this presentation in the online portal

forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including achievement of strategic objectives; future financial and operating results; and project plans, schedules, and results, as well as the impact of compensation incentives, could differ
materially due to: changes in oil and gas prices, petroleum product margins and other market factors affecting our industry; the outcome of exploration and development projects; timely completion of production and construction projects; technical or
operating conditions; the outcome of commercial negotiations; political and regulatory factors, including changes in environmental and tax laws and international treaties; and other factors described in Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent Form
10-K and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. ExxonMobil recently announced planned reductions in its capital spending and cash operating expenses for 2020 to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, government responses to
the pandemic, and other market factors affecting ExxonMobil&#8217;s business including conditions of oversupply that have resulted in historically low oil prices. Amidst these conditions, project deferrals and idling of capacity will continue or may
increase, and project cancellations could occur, resulting in lower volumes across one or more of our business segments. The capital spending reductions will result in lower near-term production volumes in the Upstream and delays in previously
anticipated volume increases in future years. Summary Annual Report. The forward-looking statements included in our 2019 Summary Annual Report (&#8220;SAR&#8221;) were based on different capital plans and projected results of operations consistent
with those disclosed at our Investor Day held on March 6, 2020. The capital plans and other forward-looking statements from our Investor Day are no longer an appropriate guide for ExxonMobil&#8217;s future business plans or results of operations. As
part of the revised capital plans noted above, ExxonMobil has identified changes in the timing of our projects discussed in the SAR. For example, during ExxonMobil&#8217;s first quarter earnings call, held on May 1, 2020 and available on the
Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com, the company indicated spending reductions in the Permian will reduce volumes in future periods, relative to our previous estimates. The company also indicated that a delay in future Guyana
developments will impact production volumes relative to our previous estimates. All forward-looking statements, including project timing and projections mentioned in the SAR, may be further impacted by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic,

objectives; future financial and operating results; and project plans, schedules, and results, as well as the impact of compensation incentives, could differ materially due to: changes in oil and gas prices, petroleum product margins and other
market factors affecting our industry; the outcome of exploration and development projects; timely completion of production and construction projects; technical or operating conditions; the outcome of commercial negotiations; political and
regulatory factors, including changes in environmental and tax laws and international treaties; and other factors described in Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. ExxonMobil
recently announced planned reductions in its capital spending and cash operating expenses for 2020 to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, government responses to the pandemic, and other market factors affecting ExxonMobil&#8217;s business
including conditions of oversupply that have resulted in historically low oil prices. Amidst these conditions, project deferrals and idling of capacity will continue or may increase, and project cancellations could occur, resulting in lower volumes
across one or more of our business segments. The capital spending reductions will result in lower near-term production volumes in the Upstream and delays in previously anticipated volume increases in future years. Summary Annual Report. The
forward-looking statements included in our 2019 Summary Annual Report (&#8220;SAR&#8221;) were based on different capital plans and projected results of operations consistent with those disclosed at our Investor Day held on March 6, 2020. The
capital plans and other forward-looking statements from our Investor Day are no longer an appropriate guide for ExxonMobil&#8217;s future business plans or results of operations. As part of the revised capital plans noted above, ExxonMobil has
identified changes in the timing of our projects discussed in the SAR. For example, during ExxonMobil&#8217;s first quarter earnings call, held on May 1, 2020 and available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com, the company
indicated spending reductions in the Permian will reduce volumes in future periods, relative to our previous estimates. The company also indicated that a delay in future Guyana developments will impact production volumes relative to our previous
estimates. All forward-looking statements, including project timing and projections mentioned in the SAR, may be further impacted by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, government responses to the pandemic, or other market factors.

engagement with our shareholders is vitally important, and keeping shareholders informed on &#183; relevant business matters is a priority for us. We also benefit greatly from engagement as it provides the Board and management with your important
perspectives. These perspectives inform the Board and factor into Board oversight of the Company. For example, this year, in response to &#183; shareholder input the Board made two significant governance changes for ExxonMobil. First, the Board
significantly broadened the oversight authorities of the independent Lead Director, resulting in enhanced oversight of Company management. Second, the Board adopted an additional new right for shareholders to call a special meeting upon agreement of
the holders of 15 percent or more of outstanding shares, with no need for a court petition. Both are great examples of responsive changes by our Board, and we&#8217;ll discuss both in greater detail in a few minutes. The Company connects with
shareholders through a variety of venues, including direct engagement with key shareholders &#183; throughout the year to maintain contact and address matters of interest. Our engagement efforts on environmental, social and governance issues have
more than doubled over the last few years. The Board also has established procedures for shareholders to communicate with individual directors, including the Lead &#183; Director, Board committee members, or the non-employee directors as a group. We
included information about the process you can use to communicate with directors on page 19 of our Proxy Statement. We welcome and value your input. It is taken seriously by the Company and the Board and has led to responsive changes by &#183; our
Board to shape the future of ExxonMobil. I will now turn it over to Inge who will review our executive compensation program. &#183; Shareholder Engagement &#8211; Slide 4 We strongly believe ongoing engagement with our shareholders is vitally

underscore three key messages, each of which we will review in greater detail on subsequent slides. &#183; First, our compensation program is aligned with our business model and long-term shareholder returns. This is most evident in our performance
share program which represents the majority of our executives&#8217; overall pay and is characterized by uniquely long restriction periods. &#183; Second, both our performance share and bonus programs deliver executive pay that is highly performance

continuously evaluates the effectiveness and competitiveness of the executive compensation program and continues to support the overall design of the compensation program for its alignment with ExxonMobil&#8217;s business model and the returns of
our long-term shareholders. &#183; Our strong governance practices further strengthen the design of the program and discourage executives from taking inappropriate risk. More details on our governance practices can be found in the 2020 Proxy
Statement on pages 46 and 47. &#183; While the design of the compensation program has not changed, we have enhanced our disclosure to respond to the valuable insights gained from ongoing engagements with shareholders and proxy advisors. Most
notably, o Consolidated the former Executive Compensation Overview brochure and CD&amp;A into one document which allows for a more holistic view of the program and connects design intent, key program features, and 2019 results. o Further clarified
the process for determining compensation to include all pay components and clearly articulate performance dimensions. o Provided additional specificity on how our Compensation Committee views Company and individual performance and experience. Key

alignment with our business model and the experience of our long-term shareholders. Our business is a depletion business and involves continual and large investments over long periods of time that require our executives to maintain a long-term view
when making business decisions. &#183; This long-term view also underpins our philosophy of talent development, intended to enable broad development and a deep understanding of the business across the business cycle. &#183; The performance share
program makes up over 70 percent of CEO direct compensation, and is marked by uniquely long restriction periods that place a significant portion of executive pay at risk well into retirement and through the commodity price cycle. This feature
enables long-term decision making and aligns the experience of our executives with that of our long-term shareholders. &#183; The blue chart at the bottom of this slide illustrates how ExxonMobil&#8217;s performance share program, with its long
restriction periods, is a better fit for our business model than a shorter-term program design. &#183; While every project net cash flow curve transitions from investment to profitability at a different point in time, in general this inflection
point materializes over a longer period of time. For example, take two of our primary Upstream projects, Papua New Guinea and Guyana. While initial investments started in 2004 and 2009 respectively, both projects did not start-up production until
ten years later (2014 and 2019). The longer bar at the top of the chart represents ExxonMobil&#8217;s performance share program where the extended restriction period results in an experience for our executives that is more closely aligned with
shareholder returns. By design, ExxonMobil&#8217;s program does not allow for all shares to vest before the impact of key decisions becomes known. It also holds executives accountable for project success many years after making initial project
investment decisions. &#183; An alternate formula-based program would require a shorter time horizon to set meaningful, credible targets. In our view such a program would encourage short-term thinking not aligned with the long investment lead times
and capital-intensive nature of the business. Performance Share Program &#8211; Slide 7 &#183; To the first point, alignment with our business model and the experience of our long-term shareholders. Our business is a depletion business and involves

approach coupled with long restriction periods defines the risk/reward profile of our performance share program. Therefore, the Compensation Committee does not adjust share grants to offset changes in share price. As a result, executives see a
one-for-one change in compensation through share price, aligned with the experience of our long-term shareholders. &#183; Uniquely long restriction periods result in a need to apply performance metrics at grant versus at vest. &#183; Key factors
used in determining performance share award levels include both forward-looking and backward-looking measures. &#183; Forward-looking measures include demonstrated leadership and accomplishments in progressing the Company&#8217;s strategic goals and
objectives, set to generate sustainable growth in shareholder value over the long term. &#183; Backward-looking measures include the Company&#8217;s performance against industry peers based on pre-established financial and operating metrics over the
investment lead times of the business. &#183; We will discuss this in more detail on subsequent slides. &#183; Performance share awards vest 50 percent in 5 years from grant date and 50 percent in 10 years or retirement, whichever is later. &#183;
These long restriction periods effectively result in large levels of stock ownership. To put this in perspective, CEO stock ownership is 38 times base salary, far exceeding standard ownership guidelines of typically 6 times base salary. Restricted
shares also remain at risk of forfeiture while unvested. &#183; In summary, the performance share program, with its uniquely long restriction periods, enables an environment where executives are incentivized to take a long-term view in decision
making, aligned with the nature of our business and the experience of our long-term shareholders. Performance Share Program &#8211; Slide 8 &#183; A share-denominated approach coupled with long restriction periods defines the risk/reward profile of

with shareholders, we received feedback to provide additional clarity on the process and considerations used by the Compensation Committee to determine CEO pay. This visual is intended to address this feedback. &#183; In determining CEO pay, the
Compensation Committee considers progress toward the Company&#8217;s strategic objectives, Company performance relative to industry peers over the investment lead times of the business, individual performance, and the results of annual benchmarking,
taking into account experience in the position. &#183; Specific to the performance share award, the Compensation Committee places emphasis on the Company&#8217;s progress toward strategic objectives where it noted significant accomplishments in
2019. &#183; The pre-established financial and operating metrics remained the same as in 2018 and include safety and operations integrity, return on average capital employed (ROCE), cash flow from operations and asset sales, and total shareholder
return (TSR), each assessed over the investment lead times of the business. Over the period 2010 to 2019, the Company has demonstrated continued industry leadership in safety and operations integrity, ROCE, and cash flow from operations and asset
sales, and continued to lag in TSR. &#183; While performance metrics are not assigned a specific weight, highest priority is given to progress toward strategic objectives, safety and operations integrity, and ROCE. &#183; Additional details can be
found on page 40 and 41 of the 2020 Proxy Statement. &#183; Specific to the Annual Bonus award, we have already discussed the strong connection between Company earnings performance and the bonus program. In 2019, the bonus program decreased as a
result of lower 2019 earnings. &#183; Finally, as to base salary, performance dimensions include individual performance, demonstrated leadership, and experience in position. More details on how the Compensation Committee considers Company and
individual performance, and experience in its pay deliberations can be found on page 39 of the 2020 Proxy Statement. &#183; A final input to the Compensation Committee is the outcome of annual compensation benchmarking to assess market
competitiveness. For ExxonMobil, evaluating level of compensation is most relevant against other U.S. companies that generally have large scale and complexity, capital intensity, international operations, and proven sustainability over time. A list
of these companies can be found on slide 23 in the Frequently Used Terms. &#183; In summary, this overview reflects the Compensation Committee&#8217;s decision to deliver market competitive pay that is highly performance based and tied to Company
performance. Determining CEO Compensation &#8211; Slide 10 &#183; During engagements with shareholders, we received feedback to provide additional clarity on the process and considerations used by the Compensation Committee to determine CEO pay.

a proposal regarding special shareholder meetings. &#183; For many years now, under existing New Jersey law, ExxonMobil&#8217;s shareholders have had the right to call a special meeting with the agreement of shareholders of 10 percent or more of
outstanding shares upon a finding of good cause in court. &#183; In response to shareholder input, this year, our Board adopted an additional right for shareholders &#8211; the right to call a special meeting by shareholders holding 15 percent or
more of outstanding shares with no need for a court petition. &#183; This means that our shareholders may now exercise the right to call a special meeting in either of two ways: o With agreement of holders of 15 percent or more of outstanding
shares, without the need to go to court, or o With agreement of holders of 10 percent or more of outstanding shares upon a finding in court of good cause. &#183; To be clear, there is no need for a court petition to call a special meeting when
shareholders holding 15 percent of outstanding shares agree to call the meeting. &#183; Our 15 percent threshold is lower than the special meeting threshold that is common among S&amp;P 500 companies &#8211; which is 25 percent. &#183; The
ExxonMobil Board, in response to shareholder input, enhanced shareholders&#8217; meaningful and accessible rights to call a special shareholder meeting this year, by adding the ability to call such a meeting without the need for a court petition. As
a result of this responsiveness and the elimination of the need go to court to call a special meeting, this proposal is not necessary. Item 5: Special Shareholder Meetings &#8211; Slide 16 &#183; Next, we have a proposal regarding special

to appropriately assess potential risks and benefits of investments. &#183; However, the proposal claims that because ExxonMobil&#8217;s products result in a very small percentage of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions, ExxonMobil is doing and
spending too much to address the risk of climate change. We disagree. We believe that efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions can have a long-term benefit. &#183; Over the last decade, ExxonMobil has invested $10 billion in lower emissions
energy solutions. All ExxonMobil&#8217;s opportunities, including those undertaken to address the risks of climate change, are rigorously evaluated to support the objective of generating long-term value for our shareholders. &#183; Many of
ExxonMobil&#8217;s investments to mitigate environmental impact also improve business performance. A good example is that safe, reliable, and responsible operations, including steps to reduce emissions, are correlated with strong financial and
operating performance. Another example is that investments in cogeneration allow ExxonMobil to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions while reducing the need to import power for our facilities. &#183; ExxonMobil&#8217;s activities and

&#183; Next is a proposal requesting a report on the risks associated with our petrochemical facilities. &#183; ExxonMobil has extensive experience designing, constructing, and operating facilities around the world, using a rigorous and
comprehensive scientific assessment process and the highest-quality data from measurements, and advanced computer modeling. &#183; Importantly, we work closely with governments and regulatory agencies, for permitting and other requirements, to
ensure appropriate operating procedures and response measures are in place to minimize potential impacts. This collaborative approach enables us to gain a holistic view of issues that may affect a specific project, and implement measures to
eliminate, avoid, or remedy potential concerns. &#183; ExxonMobil&#8217;s participation in Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, a world-scale ethane steam cracker and derivative units in San Patricio County, Texas, is an excellent example of the
Company&#8217;s risk management processes in practice. ExxonMobil, through the joint venture, worked with government regulators and local communities to address four key priorities raised by local residents: health and safety, education and
workforce development, quality of life, and environmental stewardship. This process included approximately 150 meetings with local residents and others to understand perspectives, and working closely with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality to modify facility design and mitigate regulator and community concerns. &#183; Once facilities are in operation, we maintain disaster preparedness and business continuity plans. Detailed, well-practiced, and frequently updated emergency
response plans, tailored specifically to each facility, help prepare for unplanned events, including extreme weather. A great example of this is the fact that after Hurricane Harvey in 2017, our Beaumont refinery was only shut down for approximately
two weeks, despite record rainfall totals. &#183; We also monitor and manage ongoing integrity through periodic checks on key aspects of facility structures, including adopting learnings from recent extreme weather events as part of ongoing
engineering evaluations. &#183; Information about ExxonMobil&#8217;s guidelines, measures and practices to assess and mitigate risk factors can be found in ExxonMobil&#8217;s Energy &amp; Carbon Summary. This proposal is not needed. Item 7: Report

recognize your vote is important. We want you to carefully consider this information, provided in more detail in our Proxy Statement. Item 9: Report on Lobbying &#8211; Slide 20 &#183; The final shareholder proposal requests a report on lobbying.
&#183; We agree with appropriate transparency, accountability, and disclosure of lobbying policy, activities and expenditures, and fully comply with both the spirit and letter of all federal and state laws on lobbying. &#183; In addition, and as I
mentioned earlier, enhancements were made in our proxy and on our website better detailing the process for Board oversight of the Company&#8217;s lobbying and political activities. &#183; Each year, the Company&#8217;s political contributions and
lobbying expenditures are presented to the full Board, along with the Board&#8217;s Public Issues and Contributions Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent outside directors. &#183; In addition, reviews of the Company&#8217;s key
issues are conducted by the Management Committee several times a year as part of a regular oversight process. &#183; Positions on key issues and grassroots lobbying communications are publicly available on ExxonMobil&#8217;s corporate website and
the company&#8217;s advocacy portal, The Exxchange.com. &#183; ExxonMobil&#8217;s public filings includes expenses associated with the costs of employee federal lobbying, as well as those portions of payments to trade associations, coalitions and

estimates of year-end earnings made in November of each year, such that payment can occur in that calendar year. The purpose of the two-thirds adjustment in the formula is to mitigate the impact of commodity price swings on short-term earnings
performance. Frequently Used Terms Performance Share Program is the terminology used to describe our equity program to better reflect the strong connection between performance and pay. Compensation Benchmark Companies consist of AT&amp;T, Boeing,
Chevron, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, United Technologies, and Verizon. These are the same companies noted in the 2019 Proxy Statement. For consistency, CEO compensation in the
Combined Realized and Unrealized Pay chart on slide 12 is based on compensation as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table of the proxy statements as of April 29, 2020. Reported Pay is Total Compensation reported in the Summary Compensation
Table. Total Direct Compensation is compensation granted during the year, including salary, current bonus, and the grant date fair value of performance shares. Realized Pay is compensation actually received by the CEO during the year, including
salary, cash bonus, payouts of previously granted earnings bonus units (EBU), net spread on stock option exercises, market value at vesting of previously granted stock-based awards, and All Other Compensation amounts realized during the year. It
excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other amounts that will not actually be received until a future date. Amounts for compensation benchmark companies include salary, bonus, payouts of non-equity incentive plan compensation, and
All Other Compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, plus value realized on option exercise or stock vesting as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. It excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other
amounts that will not actually be received until a future date, as well as any retirement-related payouts from pension or nonqualified compensation plans. Unrealized Pay is calculated on a different basis than the grant date fair value of awards
used in the Summary Compensation Table. Unrealized Pay includes the value based on each compensation benchmark company&#8217;s closing stock price at fiscal year-end 2019 of unvested restricted stock awards; unvested long-term share- and
cash-performance awards, valued at target levels; and the &#8220;in the money&#8221; value of unexercised stock options (both vested and unvested). If a CEO retired during the period, outstanding equity is included assuming that unvested awards, as
of the retirement date, continued to vest pursuant to the original terms of the award. 23Footnote and Definitions Footnote, slide 9 1) Bonus program is based on estimates of year-end earnings made in November of each year, such that payment can
