presentation regarding the potential for future earnings, cash flow, addressable markets, available cash from operations, and free cash are not forecasts of actual future results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future
results and goals of currently-contemplated management plans and objectives to impact future results as discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the potentials for
these efforts over the time periods shown. For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are
consistent with management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. These prices are
not intended to reflect management&#8217;s forecasts for future prices or the prices we use for internal planning purposes. We have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes
remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to model potential COVID-19 outbreaks or recoveries beyond historical pricing. Non-GAAP and other measures. With respect to historical periods,

from operations, and free cash are not forecasts of actual future results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future results and goals of currently-contemplated management plans and objectives to impact future results as
discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown. For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we
assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative
to the crude price for a given case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. These prices are not intended to reflect management&#8217;s forecasts for future prices or the prices we use for internal
planning purposes. We have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to

Available cash from operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities and (2) net cash used in
investing activities, both from the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. It includes estimated proceeds from asset sales net of forgone cash flows from divested assets. This measure is useful when
evaluating total sources of cash available, including from equity companies, for uses such as capital and exploration expenditures and financing activities, including debt reduction and shareholder distributions. Cash operating expenses (cash Opex,
structural efficiencies, or structural reductions). Cash operating expenses are a subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management&#8217;s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to
understand the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to optimize cash through disciplined expense management. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of cash operating expenses see the table on slide 31. Flexible Capex. Flexible Capex
includes those investments with minimal costs or value loss to defer expenditures, such as investments in short cycle businesses like unconventionals, projects that have not commenced or are early in construction and with limited penalty to pause.
Less-flexible Capex. Less-flexible Capex includes projects conducted for safety, environmental and regulatory reasons, projects already in execution with penalties or loss of value associated with pausing, and investments made in order to retain
rights or options for potential future investment. Free cash. Free cash is operating cash flow less capital investment. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for financing activities, applied to the Upstream
business. Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on &#8220;Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C&#8221; and identified 74 scenarios as &#8220;Lower 2&#186;C,&#8221; which are pathways
limiting peak warming to below 2&#186;C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66 percent likelihood. Operating cash flow. Operating cash flow is earnings plus depreciation and depletion, including non-controlling interests and abandonment
spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for investment and financing activities excluding
working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. 33SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Definitions Available cash from operations. Available cash from operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex,
