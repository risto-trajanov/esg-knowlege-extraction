I share society&#8217;s concern about plastic pollution in
the environment &#8211; and this is where we engineers come in. Our job is to find value in plastics throughout their life cycle, including at their end of life. We use our technical expertise, our creative application of scientific principles, and
new technologies to try to capture the full value of plastics so they&#8217;re viewed more as treasure than trash. Providing a valuable outlet for capturing plastic waste is a way to incentivize its collection and sorting, and science is required to
maximize that value. I&#8217;m talking about advanced recycling technologies that break down plastic waste to its molecular building blocks and recombines them so recycled plastic becomes equivalent to new plastic. But engineering is more than just
developing technologies to increase plastics recyclability. It&#8217;s about applying the technologies and advocating plastic pollution solutions, as ExxonMobil is doing, in uniquely challenging places. Plastic waste solutions in Atando Cabos In the
Patagonia region of Chile, discarded plastic fishing ropes were contaminating beaches. Several groups came together and launched the Atando Cabos project with a simple goal: Collect the ropes and recycle them into high-quality products. But
that&#8217;s harder than it sounds. The clean-up crews discovered the ropes were made of two incompatible materials that wouldn&#8217;t mix and couldn&#8217;t be separated. That&#8217;s when ExxonMobil stepped in. We collaborated with Atando Cabos
and found that adding our Vistamaxx&#8482; performance polymers to the ropes&#8217; two materials made them compatible and fully recyclable. Now, discarded ropes are being turned into sturdy end products, such as crates used for agricultural
purposes. In just one year, more than 1,000 tons of rope have been recycled through this partnership. The Alliance to End Plastic Waste ExxonMobil is a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is focused on developing safe,
scalable and economically viable solutions that will help end plastic waste in the environment. The Alliance aims to accelerate additional investment by proving the effectiveness of these plastic pollution solutions, particularly in markets with the
highest levels of plastic waste.up in the oceans. I share society&#8217;s concern about plastic pollution in the environment &#8211; and this is where we engineers come in. Our job is to find value in plastics throughout their life cycle, including

launched the Atando Cabos project with a simple goal: Collect the ropes and recycle them into high-quality products. But that&#8217;s harder than it sounds. The clean-up crews discovered the ropes were made of two incompatible materials that
wouldn&#8217;t mix and couldn&#8217;t be separated. That&#8217;s when ExxonMobil stepped in. We collaborated with Atando Cabos and found that adding our Vistamaxx&#8482; performance polymers to the ropes&#8217; two materials made them compatible and
fully recyclable. Now, discarded ropes are being turned into sturdy end products, such as crates used for agricultural purposes. In just one year, more than 1,000 tons of rope have been recycled through this partnership. The Alliance to End Plastic
Waste ExxonMobil is a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is focused on developing safe, scalable and economically viable solutions that will help end plastic waste in the environment. The Alliance aims to accelerate
additional investment by proving the effectiveness of these plastic pollution solutions, particularly in markets with the highest levels of plastic waste.</font></p>

ExxonMobil released its annual Energy &amp; Carbon Summary, a comprehensive look at the work the company has done to manage the risks of climate change, including actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The publication articulates
ExxonMobil&#8217;s climate strategy centered around four areas: reducing emissions from its operations, developing and deploying scalable technology solutions, providing consumers with products that help them reduce their emissions, and proactively
engaging on climate-related policy. Here is an overview. A look back: The company reported in 2019 its lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions since 2010. Much of that is thanks in part to a commitment to reducing methane emissions from its
upstream operations. By year-end 2020, ExxonMobil was on track to meet announced commitments of a 15% reduction in methane emissions and a 25% drop in flaring compared to 2016 levels.Positioning for a lower-carbon future 01.19.2021 Earlier this

on developing an innovative sensor network to continuously monitor methane emissions across large areas to enable quick and efficient detection and repair of leaks. The company is working with the University of Texas, Gas Technology Institute,
Environmental Defense Fund and Pioneer Natural Resources. Project Astra will create a network of sensors to feed data to a central system that can quickly alert the right people to fix a leak. This high-frequency monitoring system will enable
operators to more efficiently direct resources to a specific location. If successful, the project could provide a more affordable, efficient solution to reduce methane emissions. ExxonMobil is also testing a host of other solutions, including
satellites, aircraft and unmanned drones, to detect these emissions. Here&#8217;s a look at Project Astra.</font></p>
