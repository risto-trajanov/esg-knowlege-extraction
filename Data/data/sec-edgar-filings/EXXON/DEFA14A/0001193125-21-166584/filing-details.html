CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. Forward-looking statements contained in this presentation regarding the potential for future earnings, cash flow, margins, ROCE, returns, addressable markets, and cash operating expenses are not forecasts of
actual future results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future results and goals of currently-contemplated management plans and objectives including new project investments, plans to replace natural decline in Upstream
production with low-cost volumes, plans to increase sales in our Downstream and Chemical segments and to shift our Downstream product mix toward higher-value products, continued highgrading of ExxonMobil&#8217;s portfolio through our ongoing asset
management program, both announced and continuous initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, capital expenditures and cash management, and other efforts within management&#8217;s control to impact future results as discussed in this
presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown, calculated on a basis consistent with our internal modelling assumptions for
factors such as working capital, as well as factors management does not control, such as interest, differentials, and exchange rates. For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise
specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given case. All crude and
natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. Downstream and Chemical margins reflect annual historical averages for the 10-year period from 2010&#8212;2019 unless otherwise stated. These prices are not intended to
reflect management&#8217;s forecasts for future prices or the prices we use for internal planning purposes. We have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent
with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to model potential COVID-19 outbreaks or recoveries beyond historical pricing. Unless otherwise indicated, asset sales and proceeds are consistent with our internal
planning. For future periods, we have assumed Corporate &amp; Financing expenses between $2.1 and $2.7 billion annually. To illustrate future financial capacity, we have used scenarios of Corporate &amp; Financing expenses that reflect the estimated
potential debt levels under those scenarios. ExxonMobil-operated emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data are based on a combination of measured and estimated emissions data using reasonable efforts and collection methods. Calculations
are based on industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and IPIECA. There is uncertainty associated with the emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data due to variation in the
processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Performance data may include rounding. Changes to the performance data may be reported as part of the
company&#8217;s annual publications as new or updated data and/or emission methodologies become available. Emissions, reductions, and avoidance estimates from non- ExxonMobil operated facilities are also included in the equity data and similarly may
be updated as part of the company&#8217;s annual publications. ExxonMobil works with industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and methodologies. See the Cautionary Statement at the front of this presentation for additional

number of third party scenarios such as the 74 Lower 2&#176;C scenarios, made available through the IPCC SR 1.5 scenario explorer data, and the IEA&#8217;s Stated Policies Scenario as well as the IEA&#8217;s Sustainable Development Scenario. These
third party scenarios reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use and inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their likelihood or probability. The analysis done by
ExxonMobil on the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios and the representation thereof aims to reflect the average or trends across a wide range of pathways. Where data was not or insufficiently available, further analysis was done to enable a more granular
