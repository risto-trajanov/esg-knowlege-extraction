2020 Annual Report Supporting materials: Form 10-K | Legal information | Archive Download 2020 Annual Report In this report To our shareholders share Print Top To the people on the front lines - the first responders, health care workers, employees
and essential businesses - who are courageously helping all of us during the coronavirus pandemic. As a company with employees worldwide, we have a deep appreciation for what is needed to mobilize and assist people on a global scale. We have worked
together to endure unprecedented challenges this year, and we will continue to provide the critical products and reliable energy that support our heroes on the front lines and our communities around the world. We are grateful to all who stepped up
to help. Thank you LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN To our shareholders The past year was like no other in recent memory. The global pandemic took a tragic toll on people and communities, while severely impacting businesses, big and small. Yet, as is often
the case, hardships bring out the best in people, as exemplified by the thousands of frontline workers, first responders and medical professionals who are battling the virus. An exceptional commitment was also displayed by thousands of ExxonMobil
employees around the world who responded to the pandemic by serving their communities. I&#146;m proud of the way they stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products, from hand sanitizer and specialty products for protective
equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24/7 while achieving strong safety and reliability performance. Read more Positioning for a lower-carbon energy future Since 2000, we have invested
more than $10 billion to research, develop, and deploy lower-emission technologies. These investments include carbon capture and storage, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen. They also include substantial investments in cogeneration including the latest
unit, which was completed at Imperial&#146;s Strathcona refinery in Alberta, Canada. The unit produces 41 megawatts of power, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 112,000 tonnes per year, and is just one example of how ExxonMobil
is positioning for a lower-carbon energy future. We play an important role in meeting society&#146;s need for energy and at the same time are committed to supporting efforts to mitigate the risks of climate change. This is reflected in the four
pillars of our climate strategy: We seek to be an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance by 2030 with emission reduction plans projected to be consistent with goals of the Paris Agreement. Upstream operations also plan to align with the World
Bank&#146;s initiative to eliminate routine flaring by 2030. Emission reduction plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from assets operated by the company versus 2016 levels. ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS Energy for a growing population
Affordable, reliable energy is essential to facilitate improvements in quality of life, including longer life expectancy, higher education, and increased gross national income per capita, regardless of location. Today, half of the world&#146;s
population has a life expectancy of 12 years less than those living in the United States, and receives a third less education.8 Close to 1 billion people still live without electricity.7 This has enormous implications for the future of energy and
the products that make modern life possible. Global demand for energy will increase as the world&#146;s population grows by an expected 1.6 billion people in the next two decades to more than 9 billion; the middle class will expand to more than 5
billion people by 2030, with almost 90 percent of the next 1 billion entrants into the middle class living in Asia.9, 10 Read more 770 million people without access to electricity Scalable technology solutions Carbon Capture and Storage Carbon
capture and storage (CCS) is the process in which carbon dioxide (CO2), that would have otherwise been emitted into the atmosphere, is captured and injected into deep underground geologic formations for safe, secure storage. It is recognized as one
of the most important low-carbon technologies required to achieve society&#146;s net-zero goals at the lowest costs and is one of the only technologies that could enable some industrial sectors to decarbonize. ExxonMobil is the global leader in
carbon capture and has more than 30 years of experience developing and deploying CCS technologies. We also have an equity share of about one-fifth of the world&#146;s CO2 capture capacity and are evaluating multiple opportunities to expand capacity.
Furthermore, we are working on negative emissions technologies, like direct air capture, which uses advanced materials to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. Energy-efficient manufacturing Demand for industrial products is expected to continue to grow
as the global economy recovers and standards of living rise in the developing world. To meet this demand, manufacturing solutions that are more energy- and greenhouse gas-efficient than those currently available will be required. Since 2000,
ExxonMobil has reduced and avoided more than 320 million tonnes of emissions through energy efficiency and cogeneration projects and continues to target research in equipment design, advanced separations, catalysis, and process configurations as
part of efforts to develop energy-efficient manufacturing.11 Advanced biofuels Heavy-duty transportation requires fuels with high energy density that liquid hydrocarbons provide. Biofuels, such as those derived from algae, have the potential to be a
scalable solution and deliver the required energy density in a liquid form that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent compared to today&#146;s heavy-duty transportation fuels.11 We continue to progress and invest in research
to transform algae and cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels (biofuels) for the transportation sector. Global energy-related CO2 emissions by sector9 (2017, billion tonnes) Global energy-related CO2 emissions by sector9 Bar chart with 2 data series.

ExxonMobil safely provides the energy and products that advance modern life, exploring for and producing oil and gas; refining the fuels and lubricants that enable transportation by land, sea, and air; and manufacturing the chemical building blocks
for many products essential to life today. Exploration ExxonMobil searches the globe for low-cost hydrocarbon supplies that can help the world responsibly meet increasing energy needs. ExxonMobil maintains one of the most active exploration programs
in the industry, with particular focus on the deepwater portfolio. Production ExxonMobil develops and produces oil and natural gas around the world, and has deepwater, unconventional, liquefied natural gas (LNG), heavy oil, and conventional
operations. We use innovation and industry-leading technology to safely and responsibly produce hydrocarbons to meet global energy demand. Refining ExxonMobil is one of the world&#146;s largest manufacturers and marketers of fuels and lubricants,
selling about 5 million barrels per day of petroleum products, through a global network of more than 20,000 retail stations and commercial channels. Chemical ExxonMobil leverages proprietary, industry-leading technology to produce high-value
performance products. They are differentiated due to their enhanced properties and the significant value they bring to our customers and end-users. CORPORATE OVERVIEW Progressing advantaged investments 42 million project work hours managed by our
Global Projects organization in 2020. Guyana: Progressing phased development projects, including funding of a third project, Payara, in parallel to the exploration program Brazil: Advanced Bacalhau development and continued active exploration
