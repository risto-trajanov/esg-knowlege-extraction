continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, vice president of investor relations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I am pleased to welcome Darren Woods,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ll now highlight developments since the fourth quarter of 2020 on the next slide.
Across all three businesses, improved results reflect encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic as vaccinations are administered and some restrictions are lifted. In the upstream, liquids and gas realizations improved significantly versus
the fourth quarter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Production was higher, driven by lower government-mandated curtailments and higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. And
as part of ongoing efforts to high grade our portfolio, we announced the sale of most of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operated</FONT> assets in the United Kingdom central and northern North Sea. The sale price of more than
$1&nbsp;billion is subject to closing adjustments and has potential upside of approximately $300&nbsp;million in contingent payments based on commodity prices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the downstream, we continue to realize improvements in the North America refining margins. However, in Europe margins remained impacted by
COVID lockdowns. While we have seen improved demand for gasoline and diesel, jet demand remains impacted by global travel restrictions. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the winter storm, our Texas refineries were able to provide power to more than
200,000 homes through our cogeneration facilities. During the quarter we announced the intent to convert both the Altona, Australia, refinery and the Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals as overall industry rationalization continues.
In the quarter there were approximately 500,000 barrels of industry rationalizations announced. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In chemical, tight industry supply,
shipping constraints, and strong demand resulted in global average margins improving to the top of the historic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</FONT> range. We were able to capture the benefits of these improved margins with strong
reliability and the rapid recovery of our operations from the winter storm. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we have continued to deliver further
cost-efficiencies. Across the corporation, improved prices and margins, in addition to cost reduction initiatives, resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of more than $4&nbsp;billion in the quarter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February operations across all three businesses were impacted by Winter Storm Uri. Repairs were completed and operations fully recovered by
the end of the quarter. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, we established a Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize and deploy our
portfolio of emission reduction technologies. The new business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net zero emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s move to Slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative
to the prior quarter. First quarter earnings were $2.7&nbsp;billion, including $31&nbsp;million of identified items related to severance. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $2.8&nbsp;billion, an increase of $2.7&nbsp;billion versus the
fourth quarter. Despite the impacts of the winter storm, which you will see called out in the table, earnings improved across all businesses, primarily due to higher prices and margins. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There was a $300&nbsp;million benefit in the quarter from

allocation balance to preserve longer-term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results help demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remained flexible and
disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental, and reliability performance, and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we progress through this year, we&#146;ll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021
remains $16 to $19&nbsp;billion with the out years at $20 to $25&nbsp;billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we&#146;ll deleverage faster, rebuilding the
balance sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Last week we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2
emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea.
It would help bring together government incentives and private sector investment along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized Ship Channel represent some of the hardest
sectors to decarbonize. They&#146;re also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit cost. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Houston&#146;s
proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently
produces for the next 100 years. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50&nbsp;million metric tons of CO2 per
year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This
concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides
some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle, wind, solar, and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Sure. Thanks, Analyst 1. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know,
what we&#146;re looking at doing in this space in reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn&#146;t have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated in other industries, when
they&#146;re looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think the big difference with
what we&#146;re talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there&#146;s not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so I think the work that has to be
done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And we
think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government&#146;s currently spending to reduce CO2. And if you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the cost associated with
reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compared that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms, and we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So that&#146;ll be an important
part, policy to drive incentives. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren, great performance this quarter from the chemicals business. I know lot of issues
with storms, everything like that, some crazy moves in the pricing. I was just curious, do you think the chemicals business has in a sense hit a reset here and this &#151; I don&#146;t want to say Q1 performance continues, but, you know, much better
than let&#146;s say the last six to eight quarters in this business? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as you think about that, is it, you know, mostly demand? Is it
a, you know, pricing performance? We hear a lot of talk about inflation across the industry, across industries, I should say. So I&#146;m just curious what all we should think about with chemicals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Sure. And thanks for the question, Analyst 2. I would say first quarter performance in chemicals first and foremost reflects
that organization&#146;s focus on running their operations reliably and safely and, you know, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And we did a lot of work over last year, and I think moving into the first quarter that focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities
deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So, real proud of that effort. Wasn&#146;t easy, but that organization really delivered. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">34 </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they&#146;ve had for several years
on growing their high-performance products. And, you know, we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world, and that fundamental we think will continue for some time
since chemical plays such an important role in people&#146;s modern life and the conveniences of modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that chemicals make. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of course, so the big challenge here, though, is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks with different plants, that tends to result in
supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think what we&#146;ve seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then
probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, that supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then with the economic recovery and the rebound that we&#146;re seeing, that&#146;s
put some more demand into the system. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I think the first quarter reflects, you know, good operations, good performance, good
focus on growing our high-performance products and some, you know, really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">My expectation as you move forward is we&#146;ll see some of that supply come back on in the recovery from the ice storms and some of this new
capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But our expectation is we&#146;ll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the chemical business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 2: Great. Thanks on that. And then my other question, balance sheet. Obviously you made the debt repayments this quarter, commentary
about excess cash will go towards debt repayments. Don&#146;t expect you to fix the balance sheet in one year, but kind of reaffirm for us where you&#146;d like to take the balance sheet over time, above and beyond just understand you want to
sustain the dividend, but, you know, like what&#146;s the right way to think about, you know, whether it&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">debt-to-EBITDA</FONT></FONT> or a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

priorities, it&#146;s three legs to that stool, so to speak. And obviously really important for the foundation of success for the future is, you know, investing in the right projects. Particularly in the upstream with the depletion nature of that
business, we&#146;ve got to find industry-advantaged investment opportunities; in the chemical business, making sure that we&#146;re investing in the high-performance products to meet the demand, the growing demand that we&#146;re seeing around the
world; and then in the downstream, investing in strategic sites to high grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that&#146;s a critical element, and that&#146;s something that we stayed focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodities cycles and not compromise those first
two priorities that I talked to you about. And that&#146;s what we did in 2020. Obviously the pandemic was a very unusual year, much &#151; much deeper than any typical commodities cycle, so we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. I think what we said during the
Investor Day was, you know, we&#146;re going to shoot for something between 20 and 25&nbsp;percent debt to capital, and that still feels like a reasonable place to be and we&#146;ll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably
into next, obviously depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 2: Great. Thank you. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 3: Good morning. The first question that we have is on the balance sheet, and we&#146;re just maybe looking for a little update here.
Based on what you&#146;re seeing so far on the macro and with your own operations, is there any update to the $45 to $50 breakeven for 2021 to cover CapEx and maintain the dividend? I know chem&#146;s margins, they&#146;ve dramatically improved.
Downstream margins, they&#146;re still kind of below the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</FONT> band. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Yeah. So if
you remember how we did that breakeven is we made some assumptions about kind of low end of chemical and downstream margins and then average chemical margins and downstream margins going forward and recognizing that, you know, that wasn&#146;t
necessarily forecast, it was just one way to characterize it. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And the important point we were trying to make and I think we&#146;ve made historically is
as you&#146;ll look at our breakevens, you can&#146;t just focus on the crude price, that we&#146;ve got significant businesses in both the downstream and chemicals that obviously impact that. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I would say we haven&#146;t tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the
confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the chemical margins are as good as they are today says that that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we&#146;re not really
sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we&#146;ve got a plan and the foundations of that plan haven&#146;t changed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I just think
we feel better about the position that we&#146;re in today given where the market&#146;s at. We&#146;ll take advantage of it while it&#146;s here, but I would tell you that our plans aren&#146;t based on those sustaining themselves. And as I said,
we&#146;ll pay down the debt and deleverage faster given the help that we&#146;re getting from the market right now. That just put us in a stronger position for the future. </P>

&#145;21 budget, Q1 was in line with your plan. You reiterated the 16 to 19&nbsp;billion for the year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;m not sure if I missed it
somewhere, but are you still targeting the lower half of the range given what you&#146;re seeing on the macro and performance? For example, in the Permian you slightly raised your production guidance, only slightly, but is that based on the same
level activity that you originally forecasted? Are you going faster than expected? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We saw in the slide you cited the performance
improvement, but some of those performance improvements would indicate that you are going faster, so you could be doing more activity. So just wanted an update on if you&#146;re still thinking about the lower half for the year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Yeah, so I think, you know, the guidance that we gave was 16 to 19&nbsp;billion. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that has
not changed. And what I said during the Investor Day is that I expect to be in the lower end of that range, and that expectation remains today. They&#146;re not necessarily targets. It&#146;s &#151; you know, we have a plan that the business is

prepared remark is what&#146;s changed really is the progress at the improvements that that business is making. And what the chart shows you, I think, is really, really impressive performance stuff that we had talked about and believed and
reorganizing and better leveraging our technologies, better leveraging the competencies of the entire organization in this very important resource that we would see significant improvements with time. I think I&#146;ve been talking about that now
for several years, and what that organization is demonstrating is indeed they are making improvements and making that at a faster rate than we had planned. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that
business. They&#146;re basically running at their planned spend. And obviously that is &#151; that plan, you know, is across the full year, and that number will be &#151; will change over the year based on their plan. </P>

run rate in the first quarter was very low and you&#146;re expecting the full year to be towards the lower end of the range, so call it, you know, 16 to 17&nbsp;billion. You have the 20 to 25&nbsp;billion target out there for the long term, which
would obviously be still a pretty big step up from, say, 16 to 17&nbsp;billion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So just more intermediate term as we think out to, say,

plan. We&#146;ve got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We&#146;re not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges, frankly, reflect the recognition that this is &#151; we&#146;ve got a big business, a lot of variables

themselves in any one quarter or year. And so that range gives us, you know, I think, the right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we&#146;re talking to you about reflects some of that inherent variability in the plan. So we&#146;re not kind

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think the way to think about the spending is, you know, recognize we put these plans together and reviewed them initially with the board in
October and finalized them in November and then very quickly came out with a release that talked about that. If you think about the October time frame and where prices were at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was, you know, uncertainty

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we were seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not
they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so we
wanted to make sure that in the short term we conserved spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic but make sure that we didn&#146;t compromise that longer-term value. And that was the real challenge of last year, and the plans that we laid
out reflect that. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so as you move forward in the back half of this year and into next year, what you&#146;re seeing is some of those
projects, you know, resuming activities on those projects and seeing that spend go up. And so that&#146;s, I think, how I would suggest you think about that is feathering in those projects in a very managed way, that our projects organization is
working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 4: My second question would just be coming back to the Gulf Coast carbon capture
opportunity. I&#146;m frequently getting asked for ExxonMobil whether this would be more of just an opportunity to reduce your own GHG emissions, or is it something where it can be a third-party business that&#146;s actually a long-term earnings
driver for the company. So I&#146;m curious how you would answer that. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: I&#146;d say yes. I think, you know, that project
has opportunities to do both. If you &#151; again, what we &#151; what we&#146;ve been talking about for some time, and I think, you know, if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not a company was focused on managing the
risk of climate change and positioned for an energy transition was whether or not you were investing in solar and wind. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Frankly,
I&#146;ve been very encouraged of how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge, above and beyond the role that wind and solar and electric vehicles will play, which they will play an
important role, but above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">difficult-to-decarbonize</FONT></FONT> sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest
cost to society. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that&#146;s the work that certainly we&#146;ve been talking about for some time and
the work that we&#146;ve been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That&#146;s the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture, to
start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So all that was
happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is reduction in CO2. And the way we&#146;re thinking about that, that&#146;s a new business. That&#146;s a new demand that society, I
think, has a strong desire for. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so we&#146;re at the early stages of a new business, and what we&#146;ve put out there is the
opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we&#146;ve developed over decades, the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities, and this Houston
Ship Channel represents exactly that. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, you know, we&#146;d be working with a number of companies and industries there, so
collaborating with others, working with the government, and our own facilities would be involved in that. So I think it&#146;s kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Analyst 4. It&#146;s an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an
opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then again, potentially, there is a emerging market for CO2 reduction credits and may be a way to meet that market demand as well. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I think it&#146;s early to, you know, to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there and
just becomes &#151; comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that, of those emerging fundamentals. </P>

Darren, when you led the analyst day, I think you talked about or Neil had talked about something around 250,000 barrels of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">oil-equivalent</FONT> of disposal impacts in your five-year plan. I realize you&#146;ve got
the U.K. away now, but can you bring us up to date in this, I guess, stronger oil price environment whether the pace is picking up and how you see that playing out? </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Sure, Analyst 5. Thanks for the question. What I&#146;d say is, you know, we
laid that plan out quite some time ago. Neil talked about the work we&#146;d been doing in assessing the portfolio and upgrading that portfolio. And obviously, too, a couple levers to that. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One lever is clearly the additional investments in bringing in, you know, more profitable, lower-cost production opportunities and then
working on some of the tail items of our portfolio to see if others put a higher value on them, particularly given how rich the new opportunities were for us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that portfolio of opportunities remains. We&#146;ve been out, you know, actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine,
last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers and I&#146;d say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The way I&#146;d characterize it today is we&#146;re continuing that activity on those assets, and I&#146;d say the work that we did in 2020
puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve, and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there&#146;s a different view that&#146;s being taken on the future and the
horizon and the price environment which is generating more interest. </P>

and discussions happening, and we&#146;ll see if we can find, you know, the right buyer and settle on a value that&#146;s kind of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">win-win</FONT> proposition. And that work goes on, and I&#146;m optimistic that
we&#146;ll see that accelerate a bit, but it&#146;ll be accelerated based on a lot of work that&#146;s already happened and will continue to happen. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 5: Great. I appreciate that. My <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT> is really more of a kind of philosophical question,
Darren. I guess a year ago your yield was getting up there to a very, you could say, uncompetitive level in terms of if you ever wanted to do anything with your equity. This is obviously a consolidation question. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You&#146;ve got a fantastic organic portfolio, and some of your peers are now kind of struggling with their investment cases, you could argue,
meaning growth is off the table for investors, at least. So when you wrap all that together. I&#146;m just wondering, how does Exxon think about participating or not in consolidation, whether it be Permian or whether it be international? </P>

keeping, you know, kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions, you know, drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that

experiencing transitioning businesses. And from our perspective it&#146;s not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It&#146;s transitioning, you know, a business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental
drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. And if you&#146;ll look at the folks that we have on the board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large

That, I would tell you, has been a capability and competency that we&#146;ve been working to fill for quite some time. It&#146;s challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we&#146;re in, the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Then the final point I&#146;ll make with respect to some of the new directors that
we&#146;ve brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenges, how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you&#146;re moving the business in the direction
consistent with some of those broader trends but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I think
some of the new directors have got some really good &#151; a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and bring some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation
experience. And so I think we&#146;ve got a really experienced board with a lot of complementary skills. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And the final point I would
make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively, to engage, discuss, debate, I think is absolutely critical. And what we find
today is our board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating, and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on, you know, driving, ultimately driving value. And so it&#146;s, I think, a very healthy board that respects
one another but is very focused at the same time in driving value, and they&#146;ve been a big part in helping reshape the company and setting us on the path that we&#146;re on now. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analyst 6: Thanks so much, Darren. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT>
question is just on Slide 16. As you think about your growth projects, you talked a little bit about Guyana. Can you just flush out more, just how big do you see this asset becoming over time, and what are the next big milestones we should be
looking out for? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And you didn&#146;t mention greenfield LNG projects. As you think about those in the queue, where do those stand in
terms of the projects that you&#146;d look to move forward over the next five years? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DARREN WOODS: Sure. I would think with Guyana, with
respect to the potential of that resource base, it is &#151; you know, we&#146;ve talked about 9&nbsp;billion <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">oil-equivalent</FONT> barrels. I would tell you that is the current estimate, and then I would expect it
to grow. The recent announcement we made with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Uaru-2</FONT> confirmed a deeper play, and so I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity in resources that we haven&#146;t fully quantified
yet. </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I think it&#146;s a very rich set of opportunities that we&#146;re going to continue to
progress. And I wouldn&#146;t look for a big bang, per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think we&#146;ve laid out a plan that&#146;s pretty consistent with that, working very
closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource and really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we&#146;re beginning to see the benefits of that manifest
themselves and we&#146;ll continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as
we move through those developments and those projects. I think today we&#146;re talking a potential for seven to ten FPSOs, six projects online by 2027. So, yeah, feel really, really good about what we&#146;re finding in Guyana and a very
constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to LNG, you know, obviously gas is going to continue to play a really important
role as economies around the world develop, populations grow, people&#146;s standards of living grow, it&#146;s all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it&#146;s a really good
substitute for coal and the fact that it&#146;s got much lower emissions obviously and lower particulate. It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So I think gas
is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into a lower carbon future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">LNG &#151;
and so in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio and we continue to work very closely with the governments around, you know, progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and
expand those opportunities and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So that work goes on. We&#146;re continuing to have very constructive conversations, and I would expect to see those advance at a pace
that&#146;s consistent with those conversations, you know, landing at the right &#151; right frameworks for progressing those projects. </P>
