operating expenses (cash opex) are a subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management&#8217;s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to
optimize cash through disciplined expense management. 2. Includes projects that bring on new volumes. Breakeven based on cost-of-supply to generate a minimum 10% return on a money-forward basis. 3. Operating Cash Flow is earnings plus depreciation
and depletion, including non-controlling interests and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to
cash available for investment and financing activities excluding working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. 4. Relative to 2019, flat price and margin basis. 5. Calculated with U.S. EPA greenhouse gas equivalence calculator. 6.
