<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Hi and welcome to another episode of <I>InnerViews</I> brought to you by Public and Government Affairs. I&#146;m Pat McCarthy and today I&#146;m
pleased to be joined by Joe Blommaert, president of our new Low Carbon Solutions business, along with Guy Powell, vice president for planning and business development. Joe, Guy. Thanks for joining me. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> Thanks, Pat. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> Nice joining you. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Joe, I&#146;d like to kick off the conversation, I wanted to ask you about the launch of this new business. Tell me how this business came about,
why we launched it and why now? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> The corporation has been studying greenhouse gas emission reduction, actually, for quite some time, and stood
up an organization three years ago, that was really focused on deploying CCS. So building up a portfolio of ideas around carbon capture and sequestration. Now with the growing government focus, with market demand for a low carbon intensity
increasing, and then obviously also investor interest, we decided the time was appropriate to really further increase the emphasis through the creation of the Low Carbon Solution business, which focuses on commercialization of greenhouse gas
emission reduction technologies, with a lot of emphasis, obviously, on carbon capture and sequestration. So but very excited to be part of Low Carbon Solutions and to make a significant difference in this space. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> As Joe said, for about three years, we&#146;ve had this CCS venture working under the umbrella of corporate planning. And it&#146;s just the time
seemed right to launch a much, much bigger effort in the CCS space, but as well as some other low technology platforms that we&#146;re working on. So as I think most folks have seen with the announcement, it will include CCS, it will include
hydrogen, it will include the use and management of carbon offsets, it will include biofuels, it will include natural solutions, so just a much larger and broader scope than the original CCS venture envisioned. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> What is it about ExxonMobil that gives us this competitive advantage in CCS? </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> I would say from a CCS perspective, we are uniquely positioned in that we currently operate in
all pieces of the CCS value chain, whether it be capture or transport or storage. And we&#146;ve been at this for you know, 30 plus years. We&#146;re the largest capturer of CO<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2. </SUB>We have a
working interest in about a fifth of the world&#146;s capacity. We&#146;ve captured about 40% of all the anthropogenic CO<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2</SUB> that&#146;s ever been captured. So you look at our experience, and
then you look at our ability to manage these large and complex projects that CCS requires. We&#146;re just very, very uniquely positioned. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B>
Joe, tell me, this business has been started up for what, a couple months now? What is your vision for what this business can become? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> As we
progress in our thinking is that continues to evolve. And it&#146;s part of what I envisioned for my organization, this agility to adjust as we&#146;re literally starting with a blank sheet. In terms of the business aspect, obviously, we think about
what is the value of carbon, and there&#146;s actually a value of carbon that you and I currently pay. As we remove carbon, there is a cost associated with that. That means there is a market potential. And particularly when you think about what it
takes to remove carbon, there are several opportunities to do that. Several technologies. And we believe that actually through, for instance, a technology like carbon capture and sequestration, we have actually one of the lowest cost to society
opportunities, and therefore with a value of carbon, we may see a business opportunity. So it starts with the cost, starts understanding what those cost abatement options are. Understanding then that these are the lowest cost opportunities, and that
there will be a value of carbon. And that should be then the business opportunity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Darren had a recent employee forum, and he mentioned that
the Low Carbon Solution business was looking at 20 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">some-odd</FONT> projects around the world. We&#146;re going to get to Houston in a minute. But can you tell us a little bit about some of the other projects that are
being worked outside of the Houston area? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> Yeah, sure. Projects are spread all over the world. For instance, we&#146;re looking at a major
expansion of our carbon capture facility in La Barge, Wyoming. We&#146;re working some concepts in Singapore to be able to capture carbon off of our facilities there and store it in nearby countries. We&#146;re working in several other countries in
Asia that are interested in us providing them a low carbon solution, particularly as associated with the sale of natural gas. We have several things working in Europe, one in Rotterdam, one in Antwerp, one in the U.K. So we have a wide variety of
opportunities that we are pursuing all over the world. Those are generally associated with our own operating site. And then we have another set of opportunities like the Houston Ship Channel, where what we&#146;re bringing is more of an industry
solution, whereas the concept is we would collect and store the CO<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2</SUB> on behalf of others. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> I want to talk about Houston. We recently announced this major concept for a significant project that we think we could capture 100&nbsp;million
metric tons by 2040. Tell me more about this Houston concept, what it is and why it&#146;s so game-changing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP</B>: Why is it so game-changing?
It&#146;s exactly what you said. We&#146;re pitching a concept that is four times larger than the what the world is doing right now. To my knowledge, a concept like this has never been pitched or perceived before. So it really, really is a
game-changing approach relative to what others have contemplated in the past. We&#146;re targeting the 50 largest emitters in the Houston Ship Channel and surrounding industrial cluster area. The idea is we would collect up all that CO<SUB
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2</SUB> and then we would take that CO<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2</SUB> transport it offshore and store it in state and federal waters. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB: </B>In terms of why this is so differentiating. What it also does is it brings together several
industries. It could be power generation, it could be fuels, it could be chemicals. Again, it is leveraging that infrastructure across the breadth of industries. So it&#146;s very exciting to see all of the adjacencies. And where this could fit with
the city of Houston&#146;s objective to become net zero by 2050. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP: </B>I think another thing that is extraordinarily unique is the scale of the
collaboration that&#146;s going to be needed in order for something like this to happen. So make no mistake, this is not an ExxonMobil <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go-it-alone</FONT></FONT> thing. We&#146;re
going to need the collective help of multiple different industry partners. We&#146;re going to need the help of a whole government approach, and that includes local, state and federal governments. We&#146;re going to need help from the thought
leaders such as academics, think tanks, et cetera, particularly as it comes to developing the right policy structures to make something like this happen. So this is going to be a massive undertaking from the perspective of all the people that will
be need to be involved to make something like this happen. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Joe, why Houston? I&#146;m sure there are other places in the world that have
these similar types of industrial hubs and access to geologic storage. Why Houston to start? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> Houston obviously is the energy capital of the
world. But more importantly, when we look at the number of high-emitting sources, the concentration of those sources and then the proximity to the U.S Gulf Coast, that combination led us to the Houston location. When we talked about the ideas, and
the team has done wonderfully as well in identifying opportunities. And I remember we had the discussion Guy about how big is big. And we said as well as we really need to challenge ourselves and we need to really be much bigger than what we had
before because we started with a smaller kind of concept. And I was really pleased how the team challenged themselves and came back with this concept, really pleased. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> 100&nbsp;million a year is big. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB: </B>And
I&#146;m not sure is whether people realize what 100&nbsp;million tons of greenhouse gas entails. Just imagine, you know, 20&nbsp;million cars and the state of Texas must be close to 20&nbsp;million cars, so no cars in the state of Texas, that that
would be an equivalent of the emissions. Or think about the state of California being completely covered by forest. That would be the scale of 100&nbsp;million tons of greenhouse gas. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> That certainly puts it in perspective. And I know we&#146;ve said often, not only Darren and the Management Committee, but lots of other folks
within the company and in company leadership have talked about, &#145;We&#146;re going to need an all the above approach.&#146; So because we&#146;re proposing this massive CCS concept that does not mean we are against wind and solar and electric
vehicles, and so on and so forth, correct? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> Yeah, Pat, this is not a question of or, this is a matter of and. We need all of the solutions
considering, you know, the challenge that the Paris Agreement brings with it, the temperature objective, and also is the timeline that the world is on. And some of these sectors, these hard to decarbonize sectors, there is actually not a readily
available technology at scale that can be deployed. So that&#146;s why CCS and hydrogen for some of these sectors are actually the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go-to</FONT> technologies. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> And I&#146;ll reiterate the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-of-the-above</FONT></FONT></FONT> solution set that&#146;s needed. And in large part when you think about what can be used, whether it be solar, whether it be wind, whether it be CCS, you have to look at the resource
that you have available to you. For instance, in the southwest part of the United States has a fantastic solar resource. In the middle part of the country has a fantastic wind source resource. It just so happens in the Gulf Coast, we&#146;ve got a
fantastic, a phenomenal storage resource. And so as we think about what Joe just talked about, with the nature of the emissions we&#146;re trying to deal with sitting right on top of this enormous storage resource, it just makes a lot of sense to us
that this would be the solution for Houston. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> So Guy, how big is enormous? How big is the storage offshore that we&#146;re talking about here?
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> As I said, Pat, it&#146;s huge. To put it in perspective, offshore U.S. Gulf Coast has about 500&nbsp;billion metric tons of storage. To put
that in perspective, the U.S. total emissions is about 5&nbsp;billion a year. So it&#146;s 100 plus years of storage if you included all of the U.S. emissions, so it&#146;s enormous. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> So what is it about ExxonMobil that puts us in the position to be able to lead something this big? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP: </B>I think in general, it&#146;s our ability to be able to convene all the parties necessary to do something like this. It&#146;s our ability to be
able to execute a very, very large, very complex project, such as we&#146;re talking about. And I think it&#146;s also our ability to be able to position with policymakers, what does need to happen for something like this to be pulled off. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM</B>: What are we talking about here when you say we need policy? Are we talking about financial incentives? Are we talking about regulatory changes?
Both? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> It&#146;s both. So if I start with the, if you will, the regulatory and legal structures that are needed. Some policy is in place to
enable CCS in the U.S., some is not in place. And particularly in offshore, for instance, the way the statutes are written right now, only CO<SUB STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:bottom">2</SUB> derived from coal-fired power generation can
actually be stored offshore. So that&#146;s something from a statutory regulatory standpoint we need to change in order for us to be able to do what we&#146;re talking about. From a financial incentive perspective, what we have today in the U.S. is
the 45Q tax credit, which provides about $50 a ton for 12 years in order to incentivize CCS. As we look at what is going to be needed in order to incentivize something like this, it&#146;s going to have to be a higher number for a higher duration of
years in order to attract all the investment that&#146;s going to be needed for the Houston Ship Channel. I think we mentioned earlier, our estimated cost investment cost for this concept is about $100&nbsp;billion spread out over call it <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-15</FONT> years. We&#146;re looking for the right policy structures to incentivize investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> So with this
concept, it seems to me it&#146;s a huge idea. But it&#146;s going to require a lot of things or a lot of caveats. what&#146;s the biggest challenge that we have to make to get this concept off the ground? </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> I think getting policymakers to line up around a particular solution that allows this to happen
is going to be a heavy lift. We think it&#146;s doable. We think that it&#146;s the political will. We think that the concept like this is going to have attraction to both sides of the aisle, but working through those details to make something like
this a policy reality we recognize the complexity and we recognize, you know, this, this is not going to be a simple thing to do. But we do think that the will is there. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> And Joe, we&#146;ve talked to policymakers about this concept, and they were supportive? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> At several level, actually, of governments, we&#146;ve had discussions, city of Houston and actually Mayor Turner is released a statement, a
supporting statement, the state of Texas, as well as policymakers in DC, up to very senior level, actually, in the Biden administration, are very supportive. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Well, you couple this project, which we all agree is massive, along with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">20-30</FONT> other opportunities Guy
that you talked about, I can imagine, you need to build out a team. So tell me about your vision for what your organization is going to look like. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:
</B>I want tight organization- it needs to be quick, it needs to be agile, leadership will be very engaged, particularly is already in an early stage. The ability to create clarity, and particularly in an environment and in a business that is
quickly evolving, is very key. That&#146;s why it is also important we have strategy, which is Eric Oswald, very pleased that Eric has joined with upstream experience. So as we&#146;re looking at different experiences, also to create sort of an
inclusive kind of background and that we can build on each other&#146;s strengths. And then is also is we look obviously at building. This is not about planning and so <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-</FONT> there&#146;s of course a lot of
planning, but this is about deploying. And then there&#146;s also the finance marketing and commercial organization, that&#146;s another branch that will have. And particularly around financing and again, there&#146;s you know, as I want us to be
really externally oriented from from the outside, in, and particularly with finance, marketing, really understanding the market is critical, and how we then can leverage all of the capabilities that we have. So we will be looking at possibly hiring
people externally for finance, for instance, such that we can bring in alternative financing opportunities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> What kind of employee reaction
are you getting? I&#146;m sure there&#146;s a lot of excitement. Are they reaching out to you, both of you? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> I don&#146;t know if I can count
the number of emails and or communications I&#146;ve had. Both, quite frankly, internally and externally, the reaction has just been overwhelmingly positive. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JB:</B> Yeah, and ditto, for me, Pat. it was really, it was actually very heartwarming, and of all of our people, a lot of enthusiasm. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> We&#146;ve talked a lot about CCS today. But Guy, as you said early on, there are other things that are gonna be part of the portfolio of low
carbon solution, whether it&#146;s hydrogen or biofuels and so on. Can you talk about some of the other things that are that are on your plate things that you&#146;re looking at beyond CCS? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>GP:</B> Hydrogen is is one of our key focus areas. And I see hydrogen and CCS as very related, because the most cost effective way that we see to produce
clean hydrogen or low carbon hydrogen will be using methane with steam with methane reforming, which also need CCS. So hydrogen is somewhat of a derivative of CCS, but what we&#146;re seeing out in </P>

various jurisdictions across the world is a lot a lot of interest in hydrogen. And I would say particularly in northwest Europe and in Asia. That&#146;s the case. So that that in the near term is
going to be one of our one of our key focus areas. And the other the other we were looking at really closely is how we engage in the marketplace in the in the biofuels arena, and we&#146;re going to be doing a lot more work in that area as we go
forward. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> OK, so we&#146;re coming to the end, what we typically like to do at the end is we want to just put a little personal touch on and

started say one of the one of the reasons that this issue around climate change is so incredibly important to me is because I have young kids and I kind of think about my kids and the future of my kids. And I spent a lot of time with my family and
particularly with my kids, we tend to that we don&#146;t do as much cooking, we spend a lot of time outdoors. So you know, huge outdoorsman love to fish, you know, and that that&#146;s just, you know, in that think about the outdoor and the aspects
of a clean environment that&#146;s just extremely important to me. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PEM:</B> Guy, Joe, really appreciate you joining us taking the time. I know
