With respect to
historical periods, reconciliation information for non-GAAP measures is included with the relevant definition below or as noted below in the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com. For future
periods, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non- GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are
outside management&#8217;s control as described above. Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of
precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted above.
Definitions and non-GAAP financial measure reconciliations Base assets. Base assets means all Upstream producing assets excluding Permian, Bakken, Guyana, LNG growth projects, and exploration activities. Cash Operating Costs. Cash operating costs
consist of (1) Production and manufacturing expenses, (2) Selling, general and administrative expenses, and (3) Exploration expenses, including dry holes from ExxonMobil&#8217;s consolidated statement of income. The sums of these income statement
lines serve as an indication of cash operating costs and do not reflect the total cash operating costs of the Corporation. This measure is useful in understanding the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to conserve cash on hand while progressing planned
projects. Divestments. Divestments represent the unadjusted sale price specified in the applicable contract of sale as of the effective date for asset divestiture agreements which the corporation or one of its affiliates has executed since January
1, 2019. Actual final sale price and cash proceeds may differ in amount and timing from the divestment value depending on applicable contract terms. 6SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Non-GAAP and other measures. With respect to historical periods,

ExxonMobil&#8217;s internal estimates of both historical levels and projections of challenging topics such as energy demand, supply and trends through 2040 based on internal data and analyses as well as publicly available information from many
