flow, cash operating expenses, net cash margin, free cash, free cash flow, and resource potential are not forecasts of actual future results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future results and goals of
currently-contemplated management plans and objectives including new project investments, plans to replace natural decline in Upstream production with low-cost volumes, plans to increase sales in our Downstream and Chemical segments and to shift our
Downstream product mix toward higher-value products, continued highgrading of ExxonMobil&#8217;s portfolio through our ongoing asset management program, both announced and continuous initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, capital
expenditures and cash management, and other efforts within management&#8217;s control to impact future results as discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the
potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown, calculated on a basis consistent with our internal modelling assumptions for factors such as working capital, as well as factors management does not control, such as interest, differentials,
and exchange rates. &#8226; For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with
management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. &#8226; Downstream and Chemical

planning purposes. &#8226; We have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not
attempt to model potential COVID-19 outbreaks or recoveries beyond historical pricing. Unless otherwise indicated, asset sales and proceeds are consistent with our internal planning. For future periods, we have assumed Corporate &amp; Financing
expenses between $2.1 and $2.7 billion annually. To illustrate future financial capacity, we have used scenarios of Corporate &amp; Financing expenses that reflect the estimated potential debt levels under those scenarios. Outlook for Corporate
&amp; Financing expenses for the first quarter 2021 is expected to be approximately $700 million. &#8226; ExxonMobil-operated emissions, reductions and avoidance performance data are based on a combination of measured and estimated data using best

data depends on variation in the processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Changes to the performance data may be reported as updated data and/or
emission methodologies become available. ExxonMobil works with industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and methodologies. Emissions, reductions and avoidance estimates from non-ExxonMobil operated facilities are included in

With respect to historical periods,
reconciliation information is provided in the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investor page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources for certain terms used inthis presentation including available cash from
operations, operating cash flow, cash operating expense, net cash margin, free cash and free cash flow. For future periods, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP or other measures to the most comparable GAAP financial
measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are outside management&#8217;s control as described above. Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful
reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Forward-looking
non-GAAP measures are estimated in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted above. &#8226; &#8226; DEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE RECONCILIATIONS. &#8226; Available cash from operations. Available cash from
operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities and (2) net cash used in investing activities, both
from the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. It includes estimated proceeds from asset sales net of forgone cash flows from divested assets. This measure is useful when evaluating total sources of cash
available, including from equity companies, for uses such as capital and exploration expenditures and financing activities, including debt reduction and shareholder distributions. &#8226; Cash operating expenses (cash Opex, structural efficiencies,
or structural reductions). Cash operating expenses are a subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management&#8217;s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the
Corporation&#8217;s efforts to optimize cash through disciplined expense management. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of cash operating expenses see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our
website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. &#8226; Flexible Capex. Flexible Capex includes those investments with minimal costs or value loss to defer expenditures, such as investments in short cycle businesses like
unconventionals, projects that have not commenced or are early in construction and with limited penalty to pause. &#8226; Less-flexible Capex. Less flexible Capex includes projects conducted for safety, environmental and regulatory reasons, projects
already in execution with penalties or loss of value associated with pausing, and investments made in order to retain rights or options for potential future investment. &#8226; Free cash. Free cash is operating cash flow less capital investment.
This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for financing activities, applied to the Upstream business. &#8226; Free cash flow. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations and asset sales less additions to property,
plant and equipment, and additional investments and advances, plus other investing activities, including collection of advances. This measure is useful when evaluating cash available for financing activities, including shareholder distributions,
after investment in the business. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of free cash flow see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp;

Associate&#8217;s definition, is defined as gross margin at a standard price set for feeds and products, less normalized operating costs on a unit basis, expressed as $/bbl of total input. &#8226; Operating cash flow. Operating Cash Flow is earnings
plus depreciation and depletion, including non-controlling interests and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when

ExxonMobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net income, operating costs, as defined above, represent the expenses most directly under management&#8217;s control, and therefore are useful for investors and

further analysis was done to enable a more granular view on trends within these IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. &#8226; ExxonMobil has business relationships with thousands of customers, suppliers, governments, and others. For convenience and
simplicity, words such as venture, joint venture, partnership, co-venturer, operated by others, and partner are used to indicate business and other relationships involving common activities and interests, and those words may not indicate precise
legal relationships. &#8226; Competitor data is based on publicly available information and, where estimated or derived, done so on a consistent basis with ExxonMobil data. Future competitor data, unless otherwise noted, is taken from publicly
available statements or disclosures by that competitor and has not been independently verified by ExxonMobil or any third party. We note that certain competitors report financial information under accounting standards other than U.S. GAAP (i.e.,
IFRS). SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION </font></p>
