</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">Before you cast your vote on Management Resolution Item 3 &#150; Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation, please review the
content of this Overview, as well as the more detailed information included in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative in ExxonMobil&#146;s 2017 Proxy Statement. Shareholder Engagement Shareholder engagement
strategy focuses on transparent disclosure and wide-ranging dialogue between numerous shareholders and management. For 2016, this included:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; Webcast
on May&#160;12, 2016, available to all shareholders; and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; Individual conference calls on multiple occasions throughout the year with the
Company&#146;s largest shareholders. These engagements provided an excellent opportunity to discuss alignment between performance and pay, as well as the Company&#146;s long-standing philosophy that executive compensation should be based on
long-term performance, aligned with the investment lead times of the business, as our Proxy materials demonstrate. Compensation Committee Assessment of Executive Compensation Program In assessing the executive compensation program, the Compensation
Committee on multiple occasions:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; Carefully considered the results of the 2016 advisory vote on executive compensation and the insights gained from
this extensive dialogue;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; Evaluated alternate methods of granting compensation;
and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; Received input and discussed this subject with its independent consultant. Based on this assessment, the Committee confirmed that the current
compensation program best ensures an unwavering focus on the long-term performance of the business, which the Committee expects will continue generating strong operating and financial results for the benefit of the Company&#146;s long-term
shareholders. The Committee respects all shareholder votes, both &#147;For&#148; and &#147;Against&#148; our compensation program, and is committed to continued engagement with shareholders to ensure a full understanding of diverse viewpoints. <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">Say-On-Frequency</font></font> We remain committed to ensuring our compensation strategy fits with our business model and our industry. Further, the Company has a long-standing philosophy
that executive compensation should be based on long-term performance, aligned with the investment lead times of the business. Consistent with its commitment to excellence in governance and responsiveness to shareholders, the Board will follow the
frequency that receives the plurality of votes cast by shareholders on the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-binding</font> resolution. The Board recommends that future advisory votes on executive compensation be held every year. </font></p>

performance criteria apply to the vest date require greater line of sight and thus shorter vesting periods; earlier payout schedules entail a leveraged formula that could focus executives on short-term results at the expense of long-term sustainable
growth in shareholder value ? Unvested performance shares and the delayed payout of half of the annual bonus are subject to forfeiture for resignation or detrimental activity, with no accelerated payout at retirement ? Bonus clawback policy ? No
employment contracts, severance agreements, or <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">change-in-control</font></font> arrangements for the CEO and other Named Executive Officers ? No guaranteed bonuses or additional grants
to balance changes in value of prior grants For the example in chart 15, for both the ExxonMobil and Alternate programs, 100 shares are granted each year from 2006 to 2016. (1) ExxonMobil performance share program: 50&#160;percent of an annual grant
of performance shares vests in 5 years and the other 50&#160;percent vests in 10 years or retirement, whichever is later. (2)&#160;Hypothetical alternate formula-based program: percent of target shares that pay out depending on ExxonMobil&#146;s
relative three-year TSR rank versus our primary competitors: Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, and BP. TSR ranking has been determined by a Monte Carlo simulation that applies equal probability to each rank position. The Monte Carlo simulation
method is consistent with U.S. GAAP accounting principles for valuing performance stock awards. Payout schedule as follows: 200% of target if ranked 1; 150% of target if ranked 2; 75% of target if ranked 3; and, 0% of target if ranked 4 or 5. (3)

Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, retired at <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2016 after more than 41 years of service, and was succeeded by Darren W. Woods effective January&#160;1, 2017. Subsequent to his retirement, ExxonMobil reached an agreement with Mr.&#160;Tillerson to comply
with conflict- <font style="white-space:nowrap">of-interest</font> requirements associated with his appointment as U.S. Secretary of State on February&#160;1, 2017. Severed all financial ties, including all forms of compensation, benefits, and
perquisites &#149; Mr.&#160;Tillerson surrendered all unvested performance shares, earnings bonus units, and entitlement to other benefits such as retiree medical and dental benefits, and administrative, financial, and tax support Established an
irrevocable Ethics-Compliance Trust (&#147;Trust&#148;) &#149; Funded based on valuation of surrendered performance shares, less reduction to reflect guidance provided by the Office of Government Ethics (&#147;OGE&#148;) &#149; Structured to

performance shares that otherwise would have applied as a retired employee, including payout over 10 years&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#150; No acceleration except in the event of
death &#149; Independently managed and prohibited from investing in ExxonMobil, with assets managed consistent with government ethics rules &#149; Subject to specific risk of forfeiture that prohibits Mr.&#160;Tillerson from working in the oil

</p> <p style="margin-top:1pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:0pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Frequently Used Terms Please also read the footnotes contained throughout this Overview for additional definitions of terms
we use and other important information. Reported Pay is Total Compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table, except for years 2006 to 2008, where the grant date value of restricted stock as provided under current SEC rules is used to put
all years of compensation on the same basis. Realized Pay is compensation actually received by the CEO during the year, including salary, current bonus, payouts of previously granted earnings bonus units (EBUs), net spread on stock option exercises,
market value at vesting of previously granted stock-based awards, and All Other Compensation amounts realized during the year. It excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other amounts that will not actually be received until a future
date. Amounts for compensation benchmark companies include salary, bonus, payouts of non-equity incentive plan compensation, and All Other Compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, plus value realized on option exercise or stock
vesting as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. It excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other amounts that will not actually be received until a future date, as well as any retirement-related payouts from
pension or nonqualified compensation plans. Unrealized Pay is calculated on a different basis from the grant date fair value of awards used in the Summary Compensation Table. Unrealized Pay includes the value based on each compensation benchmark
company&#146;s closing stock price at fiscal year-end 2015 of unvested restricted stock awards; unvested long-term share and cash performance awards, valued at target levels; and the &#147;in the money&#148; value of unexercised stock options (both
vested and unvested). If a CEO retired during the period, outstanding equity is included assuming that unvested awards, as of the retirement date, continued to vest pursuant to the original terms of the award. Compensation Benchmark Companies
consist of AT&amp;T, Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, United Technologies, and Verizon. For consistency, CEO compensation is based on compensation as
disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table of the proxy statements as of August 1, 2016. Free Cash Flow is cash flow from operations and asset sales less additions to property, plant and equipment, and additional investments and advances, plus
collection of advances. For additional information, see page 45 of the Summary Annual Report included with the Corporation&#146;s 2017 Proxy Statement. Shareholder Distributions represent the cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and
share purchases. Shares are purchased both to reduce shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. For purposes of calculating distributions to shareholders, the Corporation only includes the
cost of those shares purchased to reduce shares outstanding. The yield represented in chart 4 is the total shareholder distributions divided by market capitalization. For additional information, see page 45 of the Summary Annual Report included with
the Corporation&#146;s 2017 Proxy Statement. Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) for the Corporation is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. For
this purpose, capital employed means the Corporation&#146;s net share of property, plant and equipment, and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. For additional information, see pages 44 and 45 of the Summary
Annual Report included with the Corporation&#146;s 2017 Proxy Statement. Statements regarding future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project plans, schedules, and results, as well as the impact
of compensation incentives, could differ materially due to changes in oil and gas prices and other factors affecting our industry, technical or operating conditions, and other factors described in Item 1A &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in our most recent
Form 10-K. References to oil-equivalent barrels and other quantities of oil and gas herein include amounts not yet classified as proved reserves under SEC rules, but which we believe will ultimately be moved into the proved category and produced.
The term &#147;project&#148; can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Exxon Mobil Corporation Corporate Headquarters 5959 Las Colinas Blvd.
