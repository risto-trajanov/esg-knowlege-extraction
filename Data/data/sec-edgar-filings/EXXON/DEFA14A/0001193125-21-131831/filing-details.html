including new project investments, plans to replace natural decline in Upstream production with low-cost volumes, plans to increase sales in our Downstream and Chemical segments and to shift our Downstream product mix toward higher-value products,
continued highgrading of ExxonMobil&#8217;s portfolio through our ongoing asset management program, both announced and continuous initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, capital expenditures and cash management, and other efforts
within management&#8217;s control to impact future results as discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown,
calculated on a basis consistent with our internal modelling assumptions for factors such as working capital, as well as factors management does not control, such as interest, differentials, and exchange rates. For all price point comparisons,
unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the
relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. Downstream and Chemical margins reflect annual historical averages for the 10-year

regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to model potential COVID-19 outbreaks or recoveries beyond historical
pricing. Unless otherwise indicated, asset sales and proceeds are consistent with our internal planning. For future periods, we have assumed Corporate &amp; Financing expenses between $2.1 and $2.7 billion annually. To illustrate future financial
capacity, we have used scenarios of Corporate &amp; Financing expenses that reflect the estimated potential debt levels under those scenarios. ExxonMobil-operated emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data are based on a combination of
measured and estimated emissions data using reasonable efforts and collection methods. Calculations are based on industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and IPIECA. There is uncertainty
associated with the emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data due to variation in the processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Performance
data may include rounding. Changes to the performance data may be reported as part of the company&#8217;s annual publications as new or updated data and/or emission methodologies become available. Emissions, reductions, and avoidance estimates from
non- ExxonMobil operated facilities are also included in the equity data and similarly may be updated as part of the company&#8217;s annual publications. ExxonMobil works with industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and

operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities from the Consolidated statement of cash flows and (2)
net cash used in investing activities from the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. It includes estimated proceeds from asset sales net of forgone cash flows from divested assets. This measure is useful
when evaluating total sources of cash available, including from equity companies, for uses such as capital and exploration expenditures and financing activities, including debt reduction and shareholder distributions. Cash operating expenses (cash
Opex, structural efficiencies, or structural reductions). Cash operating expenses are a subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management&#8217;s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors
to understand the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to optimize cash through disciplined expense management. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of cash operating expenses see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors

Free cash flow. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations and asset sales less additions to property, plant and equipment, and additional investments and advances, plus other investing activities, including collection of advances. This measure is
useful when evaluating cash available for financing activities, including shareholder distributions, after investment in the business. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of free cash flow see the Frequently Used Terms

RECONCILIATIONS, CONTINUED Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on &#8220;Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C&#8221; and identified 74 scenarios as &#8220;Lower 2&#186;C,&#8221; which are
pathways limiting peak warming to below 2&#186;C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66 percent likelihood. Net cash margin ($/bbl input). Net cash margin, following Solomon Associate&#8217;s definition, is defined as gross margin at a
standard price set for feeds and products, less normalized operating costs on a unit basis, expressed as $/bbl of total input. Operating cash flow. Operating Cash Flow is earnings plus depreciation and depletion, including non-controlling interests
and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for investment and financing
activities excluding working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. Operating costs (Opex). Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company&#8217;s products for sale &#8211;
including energy, staffing, and maintenance costs. They exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense and are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net
income, operating costs, as defined above, represent the expenses most directly under management&#8217;s control, and therefore are useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management&#8217;s performance. For information
concerning the calculation and reconciliation of operating costs see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. Peers / Peer average. Proxy industry peers

alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Project. The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in
any government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately
recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are not yet

FINANCIAL MEASURE RECONCILIATIONS, CONTINUED Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on &#8220;Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C&#8221; and identified 74 scenarios as &#8220;Lower
2&#186;C,&#8221; which are pathways limiting peak warming to below 2&#186;C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66 percent likelihood. Net cash margin ($/bbl input). Net cash margin, following Solomon Associate&#8217;s definition, is
defined as gross margin at a standard price set for feeds and products, less normalized operating costs on a unit basis, expressed as $/bbl of total input. Operating cash flow. Operating Cash Flow is earnings plus depreciation and depletion,
including non-controlling interests and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available
for investment and financing activities excluding working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. Operating costs (Opex). Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company&#8217;s
products for sale &#8211; including energy, staffing, and maintenance costs. They exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense and are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all revenue and
expense elements of net income, operating costs, as defined above, represent the expenses most directly under management&#8217;s control, and therefore are useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management&#8217;s performance.
For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of operating costs see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. Peers / Peer average. Proxy
industry peers are Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: RDSA), Total (EPA: FP), BP (LON: RDSA) Performance product. Refers to Chemical products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties
versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Project. The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the
same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be
ultimately recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are
not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term &#8220;resource base&#8221; or similar terms is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as &#8220;probable&#8221; or
&#8220;possible&#8221; reserves. The term &#8220;in-place&#8221; refers to those quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be contained in known accumulations and includes recoverable and unrecoverable amounts. 75</font></p>
