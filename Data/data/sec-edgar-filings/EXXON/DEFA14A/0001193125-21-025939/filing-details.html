provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities and (2) net cash used in investing activities, both from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. Cash Flow from Operations and Asset Sales. Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Summary statement of cash flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation&#8217;s assets
and from the divesting of assets. Cash Operating Costs and Cash Opex. Cash operating costs consist of (1) Production and manufacturing expenses, (2) Selling, general and administrative expenses, and (3) Exploration expenses, including dry holes from
ExxonMobil&#8217;s consolidated statement of income. The sums of these income statement lines serve as an indication of cash operating costs and do not reflect the total cash operating costs of the Corporation. This measure is useful in
understanding the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to conserve cash on hand while progressing planned projects. Cash Opex as used on slides 6, 8, and 14 is a proxy for this measure that includes equity company cash expenses. Flexible Capex. Flexible
Capex includes those investments with minimal costs or value loss to defer expenditures, such as investments in short cycle businesses like unconventionals, projects that have not commenced or are early in construction and with limited penalty to
pause. Less flexible Capex includes projects conducted for safety, environmental and regulatory reasons, projects already in execution with penalties or loss of value associated with pausing, and investments made in order to retain rights or options
for potential future investment. Project. The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and
acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to
be ultimately recoverable. The term &#8220;resource base&#8221; or similar terms is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as &#8220;probable&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; reserves. The term &#8220;in-place&#8221; refers to those
quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be contained in known accumulations and includes recoverable and unrecoverable amounts. &#8220;Potential&#8221; resource amounts are not currently included in the resource base. Returns, investment
returns, project returns. Unless referring specifically to ROCE, references to returns, investment returns, project returns, and similar terms mean future discounted cash flow returns on future capital investments based on current company estimates.
Investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs. 43SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Definitions Available Cash from Operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and
is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities and (2) net cash used in investing activities, both from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. Cash Flow from Operations and
Asset Sales. Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
Summary statement of cash flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation&#8217;s assets and from the divesting of assets. Cash Operating Costs and Cash Opex. Cash operating costs consist of (1)
Production and manufacturing expenses, (2) Selling, general and administrative expenses, and (3) Exploration expenses, including dry holes from ExxonMobil&#8217;s consolidated statement of income. The sums of these income statement lines serve as an
indication of cash operating costs and do not reflect the total cash operating costs of the Corporation. This measure is useful in understanding the Corporation&#8217;s efforts to conserve cash on hand while progressing planned projects. Cash Opex
as used on slides 6, 8, and 14 is a proxy for this measure that includes equity company cash expenses. Flexible Capex. Flexible Capex includes those investments with minimal costs or value loss to defer expenditures, such as investments in short
cycle businesses like unconventionals, projects that have not commenced or are early in construction and with limited penalty to pause. Less flexible Capex includes projects conducted for safety, environmental and regulatory reasons, projects
already in execution with penalties or loss of value associated with pausing, and investments made in order to retain rights or options for potential future investment. Project. The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this presentation can refer
to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms, these refer to the total remaining

gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term &#8220;resource base&#8221; or similar terms is not intended to correspond to SEC
