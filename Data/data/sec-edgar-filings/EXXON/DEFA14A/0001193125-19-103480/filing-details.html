Executive Compensation, the members of the Board&#146;s independent Compensation Committee encourage you to review the content of this Executive Compensation Overview, as well as the additional detail provided in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative in ExxonMobil&#146;s 2019 Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee reviews the effectiveness and competitiveness of the executive compensation program on an annual basis. ExxonMobil&#146;s business
involves large investments over long periods of time that require executives to maintain a long-term view when making business decisions. The Company&#146;s executive compensation program is designed to reflect this. The Compensation Committee
continues to support the design of the executive compensation program. It allows the Committee to leverage the experience and judgment of its members, across a mix of critical performance factors, to grant pay to executives that is both
performance-based and aligned with the returns of our long-term shareholders. We encourage you to vote &#147;FOR&#148; Item 3. Samuel J. Palmisano Chair, ExxonMobil Compensation Committee STRONG GOVERNANCE PRACTICES WHAT WE DON&#146;T DO No
employment contracts No severance agreements No <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">change-in-control</font></font> arrangements No guaranteed bonuses No additional stock grants to balance losses in value No accelerated
vesting at retirement WHAT WE DO Executive stock ownership policy Significant CEO pay at risk Strong forfeiture provisions Anti-hedging policy Bonus clawback policy Annual assessment of compensation design Independent compensation consultant 2018
CEO STOCK OWNERSHIP It is ExxonMobil&#146;s policy that executives maintain significant stock ownership. Restriction periods on performance shares that are three times longer than those at compensation benchmark companies result in stock ownership
levels that far exceed standard ownership guidelines. 6x VS. 32x ExxonMobil CEO Standard Guideline 90 PERCENT OF CEO STOCK OWNERSHIP CONSISTS OF UNVESTED SHARES Base Salary Base Salary </font></p>

ExxonMobil&#146;s executive compensation program, it is important to understand the industry in which we operate. The decisions and risks that our executives face play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. Therefore, the intent of
the compensation program is to incentivize long-term decision making and align executives&#146; pay with the results of their decisions and the returns of our long-term shareholders. The Company&#146;s strategies provide the framework for the
organization to deliver on its commitments, create shareholder value throughout the commodity price cycle, and address the dual challenge of meeting the growing demand for energy while reducing environmental impacts. For more information, see the

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">KEY DESIGN FEATURES WHY APPLY PERFORMANCE METRICS AT GRANT? &#149; ExxonMobil&#146;s Compensation Committee considers performance
against key metrics in its decision-making process on CEO compensation &#149; Industry-leading performance in all <font style="white-space:nowrap">pre-established</font> metrics is required for ExxonMobil executives to achieve a maximum performance
share award level &#149; Applying performance metrics at grant, versus at vest, enables restriction periods on performance shares of 5 years, 10 years, and longer, keeping executives focused on the long-term performance of the Company &#149; Long
restriction periods also ensure that a significant portion of pay reflects the outcome of long-term business decisions and the experience of long-term shareholders WHY NOT TARGET SETTING? &#149; The Committee considered an alternate program based on
a target-setting method that would have determined the number of shares at vest &#149; This alternate method requires use of a shorter time horizon to set meaningful, credible targets. This method would encourage short-term thinking, misaligned with
long investment lead times and the capital-intensive nature of the business PERFORMANCESHAREGRANTPROJECT TIMELINE ExxonMobil Program Restriction Period Alternate Program Restriction Period5103LONGER RESTRICTION PERIODS ALIGN WITH OIL AND GAS PROJECT
CASH FLOW(3)YEARS Investment Profitability LONG RESTRICTION PERIODS AND THE COMMODITY PRICE CYCLE &#149; ExxonMobil&#146;s longer restriction periods ensure that executives are required to hold shares through the commodity price cycle &#149; An
alternate, formula-based program with short-term target setting and three-year vesting would enable executives to monetize performance shares at a much faster pace &#149; In this example, shares are granted to an executive each year over the <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-year</font> period from 2008 to 2017 &#150; In 2013, on the eve of a <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">greater-than-50-percent</font></font> decline in crude price, only 8&#160;percent of
awards granted in the ExxonMobil program had vested&#150; In the alternate program with three-year vesting, 58&#160;percent of awards granted would have vested &#150; 7 times more than the ExxonMobil program &#149; Through long restriction periods,

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">FREQUENTLY USED TERMS Please also read the footnotes on the back page for additional definitions of terms we use and other important
information. Performance Share Program is the terminology used to describe our equity program to better reflect the strong connection between performance and pay. Compensation Benchmark Companies consist of AT&amp;T, Boeing, Chevron, Ford, General
Electric, General Motors, IBM, Johnson&#160;&amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Procter&#160;&amp; Gamble, United Technologies, and Verizon. These are the same companies noted in the 2018 Proxy Statement. For consistency, CEO compensation on page 8, in the
Combined Realized and Unrealized Pay chart, is based on compensation as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table of the proxy statements as of July&#160;31, 2018. Reported Pay is Total Compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table.
Realized Pay is compensation actually received by the CEO during the year, including salary, current bonus, payouts of previously granted earnings bonus units (EBU), net spread on stock option exercises, market value at vesting of previously granted
stock-based awards, and All Other Compensation amounts realized during the year. It excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other amounts that will not actually be received until a future date. Amounts for compensation benchmark
companies include salary, bonus, payouts of <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-equity</font> incentive plan compensation, and All Other Compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, plus value realized on option exercise or stock
vesting as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. It excludes unvested grants, change in pension value, and other amounts that will not actually be received until a future date, as well as any retirement-related payouts from
pension or nonqualified compensation plans. Unrealized Pay is calculated on a different basis than the grant date fair value of awards used in the Summary Compensation Table. Unrealized Pay includes the value based on each compensation benchmark
company&#146;s closing stock price at fiscal <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2017 of unvested restricted stock awards; unvested long-term share- and cash-performance awards, valued at target levels; and the &#147;in the money&#148;
value of unexercised stock options (both vested and unvested). If a CEO retired during the period, outstanding equity is included assuming that unvested awards, as of the retirement date, continued to vest pursuant to the original terms of the
award. Cash Flow from Operations and Asset Sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Summary
Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, see page 41 of the Summary Annual Report included with the Corporation&#146;s 2019 Proxy Statement. Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) for the Corporation is net income attributable to
ExxonMobil excluding the <font style="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</font> cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. For this purpose, capital employed means the Corporation&#146;s net share of property, plant and
equipment, and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. For additional information, see pages 40 and 41 of the Summary Annual Report included with the Corporation&#146;s 2019 Proxy Statement. Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. TSR is subject to many different variables, including factors beyond the control of management. For additional
information, see page 40 of the Summary Annual Report included with the Corporation&#146;s 2019 Proxy Statement. Statements regarding future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project plans,
schedules, and results, as well as the impact of compensation incentives, could differ materially due to: changes in oil and gas prices and other market factors affecting our industry; the outcome of exploration and development projects; timely
completion of production and construction projects; technical or operating conditions; the outcome of commercial negotiations; political and regulatory factors including changes in environmental and tax laws; and other factors described in Item 1A
Risk Factors in our most recent Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</font> The term &#147;project&#148; can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency
reports. 9 </font></p>

on page 9. (2) For more information, see the Summary Annual Report included with ExxonMobil&#146;s 2019 Proxy Statement and available on our website at exxonmobil.com/annualreport. (3)&#160;Example shows the integration of project net cash flow and
performance share program design; illustrates that short-term vesting occurs prior to determination of project financial success or failure and that longer-term vesting better aligns with shareholder returns resulting from investment decisions. The
project timeline is a hypothetical case that is representative of a typical major ExxonMobil project investment. (4)&#160;For both the ExxonMobil and Alternate programs, 100 shares are granted each year from 2008 to 2017. For ExxonMobil performance
share program, 50&#160;percent of an annual grant of performance shares vests in 5 years and the other 50&#160;percent vests in 10 years or retirement, whichever is later. For the hypothetical alternate formula-based program, shares vest after 3
years based on TSR performance. Values shown represent percent of target shares that would pay out based on ExxonMobil&#146;s actual relative three-year TSR rank versus our industry peers (see footnote 8). Payout schedule as follows: 200% of target
if ranked 1; 150% of target if ranked 2; 100% of target if ranked 3; 50% of target if ranked 4; and, 0% of target if ranked 5. (5) Employees and contractors, includes XTO Energy Inc. data beginning in 2011. (6) Workforce safety data from

full list of benchmark companies. (11)&#160;Benchmark company data is based on public information. Data represents the fiscal year ending in 2018. Excludes sales-based taxes and intersegment revenues. (12)&#160;Bonus program is based on estimates of
<font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> earnings made in November of each year, such that payment can occur in that calendar year. The purpose of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">two-thirds</font> adjustment in the formula is to
