ExxonMobil has a long history of responsibly meeting society&#145;s evolving need for energy in a reliable and sustainable manner. With a longstanding commitment to investments in technology and the ingenuity of its people, the Company is well
positioned to continue to provide the energy that is essential to improving lives around the world, while managing the risks of climate change. Report April&#160;19, 2021 About the Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary&#160;The Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon
Summary outlines ExxonMobil&#146;s approach to managing climate risks, including Board of Directors oversight, technology investments and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It highlights the Company&#146;s commitment to advancing
sustainable, effective solutions that address the world&#146;s growing&#160;demand for energy and the risks of climate change. Positioning for a lower-carbon energy future Under most third-party scenarios that meet the objectives of the Paris
Agreement, oil and natural gas continue to play a significant role for decades in meeting&#160;increasing energy demand of a growing and more prosperous global population. ExxonMobil will play an important role in meeting society&#146;s need for
energy and at the same time is committed to supporting efforts to mitigate the risk of climate change,&#160;as reflected in the four pillars of the Company&#146;s climate strategy:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mitigating emissions in Company
operations.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Providing products to help customers reduce their emissions.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Developing and deploying scalable technology solutions.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proactively engaging on climate-related policy.
ExxonMobil&#146;s climate strategy Mitigating emissions in Company operations Exxon Mobil&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions have declined approximately 13&#160;percent from 2011 to 2020 due to energy efficiency improvements; reductions in flaring,
venting and fugitive emissions; and the impact on the company&#146;s operations due to <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19.</font> At <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2020, the Company exceeded the emission reduction goals
outlined in 2018. These included:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;15&#160;percent reduction in methane emissions versus 2016 levels, and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;25&#160;percent reduction in flaring versus 2016 levels. The Company aims for industry-leading
greenhouse gas performance across its businesses by 2030, and recently announced new emission reduction plans for 2025, which are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">https://prod-wip.emauthor.com/Sustainability/Energy-and-Carbon-Summary/Executive-summary</font></font></font> 1/3 </font></p>

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">4/21/2021 Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary Report&#151;Executive Summary | ExxonMobil The 2025 plans include a 15 to 20&#160;percent
reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of upstream operations compared to 2016 levels. This will be supported by a:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;40 to 50&#160;percent reduction in methane intensity; and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;35 to 45&#160;percent
reduction in flaring intensity. The Company&#146;s upstream operations also plan to align with the&#160;World Bank&#146;s initiative to eliminate routine flaring by 2030. The 2025 emission reduction plans are expected to reduce absolute greenhouse
gas emissions by an estimated&#160;30&#160;percent for the Company&#146;s upstream&#160;business. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 40 to 50&#160;percent The emission&#160;reduction&#160;plans cover Scope
1 and Scope 2 emissions from assets operated&#160;by the Company. Providing products to help customers reduce their emissions ExxonMobil is responding to product demand growth by delivering solutions that enable customers to meet product performance
requirements while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These products and solutions include: natural gas, lightweight materials and packaging, and advanced fuels and lubricants. Developing and deploying scalable technology solutions Commercially
viable technology advances are required to achieve the Paris Agreement objectives. ExxonMobil&#146;s sustained investment in research and development is focused on society&#146;s highest-emitting sectors of industrial, power generation and
commercial transportation, which together account for 80&#160;percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions, and for which the current solution set is insufficient. ExxonMobil is working to develop breakthrough solutions in areas such as carbon
capture, biofuels, hydrogen and energy-efficient process technology.&#160;From 2000 through 2020, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10&#160;billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient
operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 520&#160;million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions &#151; the equivalent of taking 110&#160;million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. Proactively engaging on climate related policy
Recognizing climate change is a global issue that requires collaboration among governments, private companies, consumers and other stakeholders to create meaningful solutions, ExxonMobil has participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) since its inception in 1988, is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council and is part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative. The Company continues to engage in efforts to encourage sound and constructive policy solutions that
reduce climate-related risks across the economy at the lowest cost to society, such as supporting the regulation of methane from new and existing sources. Governance and oversight Strong governance is essential to the long-term viability of
ExxonMobil&#146;s business. Within the Company&#146;s robust governance framework, a rigorous risk-management approach is applied to identify and address risks associated with the business. Importantly, the Board of Directors and its various
committees are highly engaged and have oversight of risk management, including as it applies to climate. The Board regularly receives updates from internal and third-party experts on climate science and policy, evaluates climate risk in the context
of overall enterprise risk, including other operational, strategic, and financial risks, and considers the interactions among these factors, which includes <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-depth</font> analyses by Board <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">committees.&#160;https://prod-wip.emauthor.com/Sustainability/Energy-and-Carbon-Summary/Executive-summary</font></font></font> 2/3 </font></p>

environment (SSHE); and legal compliance matters. The Board has a well-established and rigorous enterprise risk framework to oversee risks faced by the Company, including those related to climate change. The Board receives insights on risks and
potential mitigations on relevant issues from both Company and external experts. The Board routinely reviews the Corporation&#146;s environmental&#160;approach and performance. These reviews include briefings with&#160;internal and
external&#160;subject-matter experts on scientific and technical research, public policy positions, emission reduction performance, and new technology developments. They also include at least one&#160;session each year where the full Board engages
on the latest developments in climate science and policy. In addition, directors engage directly with&#160;shareholders to gather insights and share perspectives on issues of importance to the Company, including&#160;discussions regarding risks
related to climate change. The Board evaluates climate risks in the context of other operational, market, financial and reputational risks and considers the interactions of these additional factors. The Board is supported by its committees, which
take more <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-depth</font> reviews of the context and interdependencies in risk evaluation. The role of these committees is described in greater detail below. Led by the Lead Director, the Board also oversees the
Company&#146;s response to critical issues. Recently, for example, the independent Lead Director, along with the full board, provided oversight as management guided the Company&#146;s response to the <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font>
pandemic through a series of actions that helped protect its employees, the communities&#160;in which&#160;it works and people around the world. Beyond the Board, the Management Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, provides oversight of
strategic risks and participates in briefings to broaden understanding and assess safeguards and mitigation options. Coordination and support of board committees As described above, the&#160;Board oversees a&#160;broad spectrum of
interrelated&#160;risks with assistance from its committees. This integrated&#160;risk management approach facilitates

more effectively than relying on risk-specific committees. Consideration of&#160;climate-related risks is integrated within the activities of the committees. Finance and Audit Committees The Finance&#160;and Audit&#160;Committees&#160;oversee risks
associated with financial and accounting matters. The Audit Committee also periodically reviews ExxonMobil&#146;s overall risk management approach and structure, which is applied to risks related to climate change, among other business risks. Board
Affairs Committee The Board Affairs Committee&#160;oversees matters of corporate governance, including Board evaluation and director refreshment. It also coordinates identification of external experts, including those addressing the energy
transition, to provide insights to the Board and sets the criteria for shareholder engagement with directors. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee&#160;reviews executive compensation, which is designed to incentivize executives to
maximize long-term shareholder value and requires decision-making that includes careful consideration of current and future risks, such as those related to climate change. Public Issues&#160;&amp; Contributions Committee The Public Issues and
Contributions Committee&#160;(PICC) oversees operational risks such as those relating to safety, security, health, lobbying activities, and expenditures and environmental performance, including actions taken to address climate-related risks.
Integrating risk management into executive compensation Senior executive compensation is determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation program is designed to incentivize effective management of all operating and financial risks
associated with ExxonMobil&#146;s business, including risks related to climate change. Performance shares with long vesting periods and a strong tie to Company performance are among the key design&#160;features that support this objective. Executive
compensation is designed to support long-term sustainability of Company operations and management of all aspects of risk. Specifically, performance in managing risks related to climate change is recognized in two performance dimensions that are
linked to the Company&#146;s performance share program:&#160;(1) Progress Toward Strategic Objectives, which includes reducing&#160;environmental impacts as one of five objectives, and (2)&#160;Safety and Operations Integrity, which includes
environmental performance in addition to safety and controls. These performance dimensions are shown in the schematic on the right. The executive compensation program requires that these longer-term risks be carefully considered at all levels of the
organization, ensuring stewardship beyond the Board and executive level, and is fundamental to success across the

Over the coming decades, oil and natural gas will continue to play a critical role in meeting the world&#146;s energy demand,&#160;even considering the&#160;Intergovernmental Panel&#160;on Climate Change (IPCC) Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The following
analysis is intended to address the potential impacts to the Company&#146;s proved reserves&#160;and resources1&#160;through 2040 and beyond, considering&#160;the average of the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios&#146; oil and natural gas growth rates.2
Proved reserves ExxonMobil believes that over the long term, proved reserves are one of the main drivers of intrinsic value of an integrated oil and natural gas company&#146;s upstream operations.3&#160;At the end of 2020,&#160;ExxonMobil&#146;s
proved reserves totaled about 15&#160;billion <font style="white-space:nowrap">oil-equivalent</font> barrels, comprised of 60&#160;percent oil and 40&#160;percent natural gas4. These proved reserves are assessed annually and reported&#160;in the
Company&#146;s annual&#160;report on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-K</font> in accordance with rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on currently anticipated&#160;production schedules, a substantial&#160;majority of
ExxonMobil&#146;s <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2020 proved reserves are expected to have been produced by 2040. Since the average of the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios implies significant use of oil and natural gas through&#160;the
middle of the century, these reserves face little risk from declining demand. Significant investment still needed in 2&#176;C scenarios Considering the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios average, global&#160;liquids demand is projected to decline from
98&#160;million barrels per day in 2019 (note that 2020 demand of 88&#160;million barrels per day was significantly impacted by <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> restrictions) to about 75&#160;million barrels per day in 2040. Without
future investment and due to natural field decline, world&#160;liquids production would&#160;be expected to drop to about 22&#160;million barrels per day in 2040, greatly exceeding the potential demand reduction.&#160;Natural gas field decline rates
are generally similar to liquids. With the potential 2040 imbalance (absent&#160;future investment), the substantial majority of ExxonMobil&#146;s proved reserves that are projected to be produced by 2040 are&#160;supported by ample demand, and
therefore&#160;face little risk related to the average of the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. Considering the IEA&#146;s SDS&#160;(a well&#160;below 2&#176;C scenario), the IEA estimated that almost $12 trillion of investment will&#160;be needed for
oil and natural gas supply for 2020-2040.5 Additionally, the IEA has reported that current industry investment levels are well&#160;below what is needed in these IEA scenarios, indicating&#160;a critical need for increased oil and natural gas
investment versus 2020 levels.6 </font></p>

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">For the remaining <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2020 proved reserves that are projected to be produced beyond 2040,
the reserves are generally associated with assets where the majority of development costs are incurred before 2040. While these proved reserves may be subject to more stringent climate-related&#160;policies in the future, technology advancements and
targeted&#160;investments could mitigate production-related emissions and associated costs. In addition, these assets have generally lower risk given the technical knowledge&#160;accumulated over many decades of production. Accordingly, the
production of these reserves will likely remain economic even considering the average oil&#160;and natural gas demand&#160;under the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. Resources ExxonMobil&#160;maintains a large and diverse portfolio of undeveloped
resources that provide considerable flexibility to develop new supplies to meet future energy demand and replenish the Company&#146;s proved reserves. The Company also continues to enhance the quality of this resource base through successful
exploration, acquisitions, divestments, and ongoing&#160;development planning and appraisal activities. Under the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios, the world will continue to require significant investment in both liquids and natural gas. Based on these
scenarios, and assuming ExxonMobil retains its current share of global production,7&#160;the Company would need to replenish its existing proved reserves entirely by 2040 under the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios average. For ExxonMobil, the underlying
economics of commercializing resources are dependent on a number of factors, including evolving government regulations, that are assessed annually using a dynamic resource development process. The best resource opportunities are advanced and assets
with lower potential are monetized or exited. All investments are tested over a wide range of commodity price assumptions and market conditions. Notably, the IEA&#146;s estimates of future prices under its 2&#176;C pathway fall within the range used
to test investments.8 Reducing costs using technology to improve competitive position Trillions of dollars of investment in oil&#160;and natural&#160;gas will&#160;be needed, even in&#160;2&#176;C scenarios.&#160;By
leveraging&#160;high-impact&#160;technologies from ExxonMobil&#146;s research organization, costs and environmental&#160;impacts are reduced,&#160;positioning the Company&#146;s portfolio to compete successfully. </font></p>

that influence governments&#146; diverse approaches to regulate resources and decisions by industry to commercialize undeveloped resources, it is not possible to identify which specific assets will ultimately be developed. However, the Company is
confident that the size, diversity and continued upgrading of resources will enable the ongoing replenishment of proved reserves under a range of potential future demand scenarios and regional policy differences. Regional policies that constrain
supply in one area could enhance returns in others. Dynamic resource development planning This process considers a wide range of variables over time, including as appropriate: the extent and quality of the resource, development concepts, fiscal
terms, regulatory requirements, proximity to existing infrastructure, market conditions, enabling technologies, and policy developments, including climate-related policy. ExxonMobil optimizes resource development plans in line with these variables
and prioritizes developments that are competitively advantaged in delivering long-term shareholder value. A rigorous Decision Quality Framework is employed to inform development decisions ranging from developing the resource (which eventually moves
to proved reserves), monetizing the resource by selling it to others, or exiting the asset. With a very large resource base, this process can take decades as technologies are developed, market conditions change and competition evolves. Two examples
illustrate this: Liza phase 1 development The Liza field was discovered in May 2015 offshore Guyana. ExxonMobil&#146;s approach to development planning enabled an industry leading <font style="white-space:nowrap">start-up</font> in less than five

important energy sources even across the Intergovernmental Panel&#160;on Climate Change (IPCC) Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. Natural gas is expected to play a key role in the projected demand shift from coal to lower-emission fuels for power generation
and industrial use. ExxonMobil is progressing 12&#160;million tonnes per year of <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</font> liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply opportunities to meet the growing global demand. This includes potential projects in
Papua New Guinea (PNG), Mozambique and in the United States. As one of the largest natural gas producers in the U.S. and a significant producer of LNG around the world, the Company is well positioned to meet the future demand for these resources.
Rising oil demand will be driven by commercial transportation and the chemical industry&#146;s use of oil as a feedstock; fuel demand for light-duty vehicles is expected to decrease, reflecting efficiency improvements and growth in alternative
fuels. Downstream A tanker being loaded with LNG at ExxonMobil&#146;s terminal in Papua New Guinea.&#160;Global demand for commercial transportation fuels, higher-value lube basestock grades, and finished lubricants is expected to grow, while
worldwide gasoline demand will likely peak and then begin declining. Over the past several decades, through the application of advantaged technologies, capital redeployment and divestment, ExxonMobil has created a resilient portfolio of
manufacturing sites. Portfolio improvement activity included the divestment of 22 of 43 refinery sites since 2000. In addition, competitiveness has been improved by <font style="white-space:nowrap">co-locating</font> approximately 80&#160;percent of
refining capacity with chemical or lube basestock manufacturing. ExxonMobil&#146;s average refinery throughput is 75&#160;percent larger than industry providing economies of scale for lower cost transportation fuel production. The Company invests in
advantaged, integrated assets with proprietary process and catalyst technology to improve the yield of high-value products consistent with demand trends. This continuous high-grading of the portfolio has positioned the Company&#146;s downstream
business to remain competitive across a wide range of future scenarios (see chart below). </font></p>

40&#160;percent by 2030, underpinned by global population growth, an expanding middle class and demand for increased living standards. These factors, together with a recognition of the lower greenhouse gas emissions of plastics versus
alternatives,1&#160;correspond to an increase in demand for a variety of everyday products, from food packaging to appliances, vehicle parts to clothing. Many of ExxonMobil&#146;s chemical products&#160;help customers reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions by making cars lighter and more fuel efficient, improving recyclability and extending products&#145; shelf life, therefore, reducing waste. Due to robust growing demand, the Company&#146;s investment strategy is targeted at high-value
sectors with approximately 70&#160;percent of new planned capacity additions focused on its performance products (see chart below).&#160;Potential new areas of investment In addition to major capital investments in base business lines, the Company
is also investing in significant research and development (R&amp;D) programs that will create potential opportunities to enhance and expand its portfolio. These programs include R&amp;D efforts in CCS, hydrogen, advanced biofuels&#160;and

(CCS) is the process of capturing CO2 that would have otherwise been emitted to the atmosphere from industrial facilities and power plants, transporting the captured CO2&#160;to a carefully selected storage site and then injecting the CO2&#160;into
deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. Direct air capture uses advanced materials to capture CO2&#160;from the atmosphere so that it can be stored in geological formations. CCS is one of the most important <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-carbon</font> technologies required to achieve societal climate goals at the lowest cost. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated in its Fifth Assessment Report that the cost of achieving a
2&#176;C outcome would increase by 138&#160;percent if CCS were not included in the set of decarbonization solutions.1 CCS is generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions, via
<font style="white-space:nowrap">bio-energy</font> with CCS (BECCS) or direct air capture methods. In many <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-carbon</font> transition scenarios, negative emissions technologies are needed to reduce atmospheric
CO2&#160;concentration. CCS is also one of the only technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, concrete and steel sectors. This could be achieved by directly capturing CO2&#160;emissions
from these industrial sources or by using CCS in conjunction with hydrogen production to provide decarbonized fuel to these processes. Click here for more information on the role of CCS under the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C&#160;scenarios. ExxonMobil is a
global leader in CCS and has more than 30 years of experience developing and deploying CCS technologies. The Company has equity share of about <font style="white-space:nowrap">one-fifth</font> of the world&#146;s CO capture capacity,2 and has
projects operating in the United 2 States, Australia and Qatar. ExxonMobil&#146;s annual carbon capture capacity is about 9&#160;million tonnes, the equivalent emissions of approximately 2&#160;million passenger vehicles per year. Since CCS began in
the early 1970s, ExxonMobil has cumulatively captured more CO2&#160;than any other company, accounting for approximately 40&#160;percent of all the anthropogenic CO that has ever been captured.3 The Company is working to expand 2 capacity and is
evaluating multiple opportunities that have the potential to be commercially attractive through the convergence of supportive policy and technology. In the Netherlands, ExxonMobil is working to advance both the Port of Rotterdam
CO2&#160;Transportation Hub and Offshore Storage (PORTHOS) project and the <font style="white-space:nowrap">H-Vision</font> study in the Rotterdam industrial area. With potential support from the European and Dutch governments, the initiatives could

As noted in last year&#146;s Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary, ExxonMobil contributed to the National Petroleum Council&#146;s report on <font style="white-space:nowrap">at-scale</font> deployment of CCS. The Council&#146;s policy, regulatory and legal recommendations set out a road map for accelerating the deployment of CCS investment in the United States. Alongside the Energy Advance

ExxonMobil has a robust set of processes to improve energy efficiency and mitigate emissions, including programs focused on reducing methane emissions, flaring and venting. These processes include, where appropriate, setting tailored objectives at
the business, site and equipment level, and then stewarding progress toward meeting those objectives. This rigorous approach is effective to promote efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in operations while striving to achieve
industry-leading performance.&#160;Report April&#160;19, 2021 ExxonMobil&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions have declined approximately 13&#160;percent (see chart below) from 2011 to 2020. The greenhouse gas emissions from the base facilities that were
in operations in 2011 have decreased nearly 27&#160;percent (approximately 33&#160;million tonnes), primarily due to portfolio optimization; energy efficiency improvements; reductions in flaring, venting and fugitive emissions; and the impact on the
company&#146;s operations&#160;due to <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19.</font> Meanwhile, the greenhouse gas emissions from acquisitions, expansions, new developments and facilities (shown as growth projects) was approximately
20&#160;percent of total emissions in 2020.&#160;The greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity used in ExxonMobil&#145;s operations represents more than 10&#160;percent of net equity greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, using energy more
efficiently is a powerful tool to reduce emissions. An effective way to increase efficiency is through cogeneration, a process that simultaneously produces electricity while capturing useful heat or steam for industrial uses. ExxonMobil has interest
in approximately 5,500 megawatts of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 installations around the world and is continuing to pursue additional economic cogeneration opportunities. In late 2020, a cogeneration unit began operating at the Strathcona
refinery in Canada. It produces approximately 41 megawatts of power and is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 112,000 tonnes per year versus separate steam and power generation &#150; the equivalent to taking nearly 24,000
vehicles off the

2018, ExxonMobil announced two <font style="white-space:nowrap">12-year</font> agreements with Lincoln Clean Energy for the purchase of 500 MWs of wind and solar electricity. Sage Drew, the operator of the wind facilities, began generating power to
the electricity grid in Texas (ERCOT) in December of 2019; and the solar plant is currently active. Both plants are expected to avoid approximately 800,000 tonnes of CO2 per year by replacing 70&#160;percent of power purchased by the Company from
the ERCOT grid with carbon-free power. Additional power purchase agreements are being evaluated around the world. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has invested over $10&#160;billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions.
ExxonMobil also continues to expand collaborative efforts with other companies and academic institutions.

emissions by 2050, and continues to advocate for policies that promote cost-effective solutions to address the risks of climate change. In this regard, ExxonMobil submitted a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking docket
indicating support for reasonable, cost-effective regulations to manage methane emissions from new and existing sources. ExxonMobil submitted a similar statement to the European Commission as it was developing a methane strategy for the European
Union. The Company also published a model framework for industry-wide methane regulations and urged stakeholders, policymakers and governments to develop comprehensive, enhanced rules to reduce emissions in all phases of production and across the
full natural gas value chain.&#160;In addition, ExxonMobil was a founding member, and remains highly involved in the Methane Guiding Principles1 &#150; an international multi-stakeholder initiative now comprising more than 20 companies and 15
supporting organizations that work together to address methane emissions across the full natural gas value chain. Under the Methane Guiding Principles, ExxonMobil is a primary sponsor of the IEA&#146;s Methane Tracker,2 a <font style="white-space:nowrap">web-based</font> information portal that provides information on global emissions, mitigation measures, and regulatory approaches. The Company also participates in the Methane Guiding Principles&#146; <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-operated</font> joint venture and policy-related work streams.&#160;ExxonMobil supports strong measurement, reporting and verification standards as part of a broad suite of regulations to address oil and natural gas
related methane emissions. To that end, the Company is actively engaged with organizations such as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, the Collaboratory for Advancing Methane Science, the Environmental Partnership, and the Methane Guiding
Principles, mentioned previously, to continue to improve the accuracy and transparency of how industry approaches methane emissions measurement, reporting and verification. ExxonMobil participates in the recently formed International Association of
Oil&#160;&amp; Gas Producers/IPIECA/OGCI Task Force for Recommended Practices for Methane Emission Detection&#160;&amp; Quantification Technologies.&#160;ExxonMobil is also working with trade associations to encourage consensus on the need to
develop policy positions and/or best practices on methane emissions inventory and management, as well as technology and innovation, most recently for example, with the American Exploration&#160;&amp; Production Council (AXPC), the Natural Gas Supply

methane emissions across large areas to enable quick and efficient detection and repair of leaks. This high-frequency monitoring system will enable operators to more efficiently direct resources to a specific location and could provide a more
affordable, efficient solution to reduce methane emissions. In addition, the Company is testing novel analytical systems that can be deployed in helicopters, airplanes and drones to detect fugitive emissions.&#160;The Company is also exploring the
use of satellite surveillance where data can be regularly updated each time satellites orbit the earth. These technology investments complement the Company&#146;s voluntary methane management program that includes structured leak detection and

emissions&#160;in its operations by 2025, compared to 2016 levels, while aiming for industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its businesses by 2030. The 2025 plans include a 15 to 20&#160;percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of
upstream operations. The reductions will be supported by a 40 to 50&#160;percent reduction in methane intensity; and a 35 to 45&#160;percent reduction in flaring intensity. The Company also plans to eliminate routine flaring by 2030 in upstream
operations, as defined by the World Bank. The 2025 emission reduction plans include actions that are expected to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30&#160;percent for the Company&#146;s upstream business. Similarly, absolute
flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 40 to 50&#160;percent.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions data for many years. The 2025 emission reduction plans are based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Report April&#160;19, 2021
Reporting Scope 1 emissions data (direct greenhouse gas emissions from Company operations) provides useful insight into the efficiency and emission-reduction performance of the Company&#146;s operations, portfolio of products, business sectors
served and resource type.&#160;Reporting Scope 2 emissions data (indirect greenhouse gas emissions from energy purchased by the Company) highlights the Company&#146;s choice of energy sources, primarily purchases of electricity to power its
operations. Noting that stakeholders have expressed growing interest in Scope 3 data, the Company is providing Scope 3 information in the table below and plans to do so on an annual basis. Scope 3 includes the indirect emissions resulting from the
consumption and use of the Company&#146;s products.&#160;Because Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are within the direct control of a company, the criteria for identifying and reporting them is well established, transparent and consistent across
industries. Reporting Scope 3 emissions, however, is less certain and less consistent because it includes the indirect emissions resulting from the consumption and use of a company&#146;s products occurring outside of its control. Evaluating a
company&#146;s Scope 3 emissions and comparing them to other companies can be challenging due to inconsistent reporting methodologies, as well as potential duplication, inconsistencies and inaccuracies that may occur when reporting emissions that
are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization. The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) acknowledges these issues.1 Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions do not
provide meaningful insight into the Company&#146;s emission-reduction performance and could be misleading in some respects. For example, increased natural gas sales by ExxonMobil that reduce the amount of coal burned for power generation would
result in an overall reduction of global emissions but would increase Scope 3 emissions reported by the Company.&#160;Ultimately, changes in society&#146;s energy use coupled with the development and deployment of affordable lower-emission
technologies will be required to drive meaningful Scope 3 emissions reductions.&#160;To do its part and support society&#146;s ambition of <font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> emissions by 2050, ExxonMobil is committed to continuing to
invest in new technologies that can potentially reduce emissions at scale. As highlighted throughout the Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary, the Company is focusing its competencies on developing breakthrough technology that could reduce emissions
from the three sectors that emit 80&#160;percent of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions: power generation, industrial processes and commercial transportation. The Company is also partnering with governments, academia and industry to research
and commercialize biofuels, direct air capture, and lower the cost of carbon capture and storage.&#160;ExxonMobil&#146;s focus and commitment to supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement are further detailed in the forward-looking
emission-reduction plans described in the Metrics and Targets section.

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">4/22/2021 Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary&#146;s Frequently asked questions | ExxonMobil Energy and Carbon Summary Frequently asked
questions Report April&#160;19, 2021 &#238;&#164;&#149; How are ExxonMobil&#146;s operations and investments aligned with the Paris Agreement? ExxonMobil supports the goals of the Paris Agreement,1 an agreement among national governments to
reduce carbon emissions from their economies. The Company&#146;s Outlook for Energy, which informs its business strategy and investments, projects future energy supply and demand, and aligns in aggregate with the Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) submitted by Paris Agreement signatories, which outline each country&#146;s plans to reduce its emissions. ExxonMobil&#146;s greenhouse gas emission reduction plans announced in 2020 are projected to be on a pathway consistent with the goals
of the Paris Agreement.&#160;The Company&#146;s strategy focuses on the dual challenge of meeting the growing demand for energy to support economic development around the world while minimizing environmental impacts and the risks of climate change.
ExxonMobil believes it has an important role to play in helping reduce climate risks through its commitment to manage operational emissions, produce cleaner, more advanced products, conduct fundamental research into new technology solutions, and
engage in climate policy discussions. Over the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10&#160;billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions. These solutions have resulted in highly efficient operations that
have eliminated or avoided approximately 520&#160;million tonnes of greenhouse gas&#160;emissions. The Company continues to deploy its competencies in breakthrough technology development to pursue advances in the high-emission sectors where current
technologies are insufficient to achieve deep reductions. These sectors &#150; power generation, commercial transportation and industrial &#150; represent about 80&#160;percent of current energy-related CO2 emissions and are projected to increase
with population growth and economic development. Further advances in these areas are critical to reducing emissions and would make a meaningful contribution to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.&#160;As governments around the world
implement policies to meet their respective emission-reduction goals, demand for more carbon-intensive energy products will be reduced.&#160;However, even under 2&#176;C scenarios, a growing and increasingly prosperous global population will increase
energy demand and still require significant investment in new supplies of oil and natural gas. The IEA&#146;s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) estimates the world will still need 66&#160;million barrels of oil per day in 20402. However,
without further investment, the impact of depletion would result in oil production of just 22&#160;million barrels of oil per day in 2040.3 The IEA estimates $12 trillion of additional oil and natural gas investment is needed to meet the oil and
natural gas demand in the SDS.&#160;Noting the Paris Agreement did not contemplate voluntary commitments from individual companies, and that advancing the goals of Paris can occur in a number of ways (including replacing more emission-intensive
activities with less intensive activities), ExxonMobil&#146;s announced greenhouse gas plans are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. For example, planned reductions in upstream emissions through 2025 would be consistent
with the goals of a <font style="white-space:nowrap">2-degree</font> pathway (which envisions a global emissions reduction of about 10&#160;percent in 2025 versus 20164).&#160;&#238;&#164;&#149; Does ExxonMobil have to reduce its production to
align with the Paris Agreement?

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">4/22/2021 Energy&#160;&amp; Carbon Summary&#146;s Frequently asked questions | ExxonMobil The Paris Agreement does not contemplate or
require individual companies to decrease production to align with the goal of maintaining global temperature rise to below 2&#176;C. The structure of the agreement recognizes that energy-related emissions are driven by society&#146;s demand for
energy &#150; not its supply. Improved efficiency, effective government policies and informed consumer choices are more effective measures to address demand.&#160;With respect to energy supply, production reductions by individual companies would
have no impact on demand or consumption of energy, and would simply result in production shifting from one producer to another. In addition, shifting of production would not necessarily reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced and, in some
cases, the opposite could be true. The transfer of production from <font style="white-space:nowrap">well-run,</font> highly efficient operators to less-efficient producers, for example, could actually increase emissions associated with the
production of oil and natural gas, and finished products. Society benefits when the most efficient operators lead energy development efforts. ExxonMobil has a long history of industry-leading operational performance. For example, the Company&#146;s
refining operations have consistently ranked in the top quartile for energy efficiency in the key refining industry benchmark survey by Solomon Associates.5&#160;In ExxonMobil&#146;s chemical business, advanced efficiency technologies and techniques
have reduced net equity greenhouse gas emissions intensity by nearly 8&#160;percent between 2013 and 2020.&#160;In addition, as of 2020 the Company reported over a 34&#160;percent reduction in methane emissions in its U.S. unconventional production
through a series of industry-leading best practices such as equipment upgrading and enhanced use of technology to improve inspections. ExxonMobil exceeded its goal to reduce company-wide methane emissions by 15&#160;percent and flaring by
25&#160;percent by <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2020.&#160;Recently, ExxonMobil announced plans to reduce the intensity of operated upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20&#160;percent by 2025, compared to 2016 levels. This
will be supported by a 40 to 50&#160;percent decrease in methane intensity, and a 35 to 45&#160;percent decrease in flaring intensity across its global operations, as well as other measures. The Company&#146;s upstream operations also plan to align
with the World Bank&#146;s initiative to eliminate routine flaring by 2030. The plan is projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and will drive meaningful near-term emission reductions as the Company works toward
industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its business lines.&#160;ExxonMobil&#146;s emission reduction plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from assets operated by the Company. The plans will leverage the continued application of
operational efficiencies and ongoing development and deployment of lower-emission technologies such as carbon capture and storage. While the Company&#146;s voluntary efforts are important, they capture only a fraction of industry&#146;s overall
methane emissions, which is why ExxonMobil works with policymakers to improve effectiveness of regulations so that all of industry participates to maximize the benefits to society.&#160;&#238;&#164;&#149; What is ExxonMobil doing to prepare for a
lower-carbon future while meeting energy needs of a growing population? ExxonMobil plays a critical role in providing the energy that supports economic growth and improves the quality of life for people around the world. Major forecasts project
energy demand to increase as the global population rises to well over 9&#160;billion by 2040 from 7.5&#160;billion today, and because of growing prosperity and an expanding middle class.6 Even under 2&#176;C and
<font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> scenarios, meeting this increase in energy demand will require significant investment in new supplies of oil and natural gas, generally consistent with ExxonMobil&#146;s investment levels. This is
mainly due to the significant natural decline rates associated with oil and natural gas production. At the same time, there is a need to

market-based policies that place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon will drive emission reductions at the lowest cost to society while supporting technology innovation and deployment. Technology innovation is critical because the current solution
set is insufficient to reduce emissions to targeted levels at an acceptable cost to society. According to the IEA, only six of 46 important technologies and sectors are on track to help society reach the Paris Agreement goals.7&#160;Meeting these

growing population with growing energy needs.&#160;The IPCC pathways that lead to net zero and limit warming to less than 2&#176;C show important trends, including increase in renewables (wind and solar), decrease in coal, increase in use of carbon
dioxide removal (CDR), increase in carbon capture, and focused efforts to reduce other greenhouse gases and aerosols that cause warming. The IEA&#146;s <font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> emissions by 2050 scenario, a <font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> analysis through 2030, also reached similar conclusions on needed CO2 reductions through deployment of all key technologies.&#160;ExxonMobil continues to help meet global oil and natural gas demand, which
is projected to continue even in a rapid <font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> transition, while working to reduce the Company&#146;s emissions of greenhouse gases. The Company also plays an important role in helping to improve technology
that would be useful in <font style="white-space:nowrap">net-zero</font> pathways including biofuels, carbon capture, direct air capture, reduction of methane including advanced measurement and monitoring, and technology to enable low greenhouse gas
energy such as hydrogen.&#160;The pathways that lead to net zero involve a transition of all major regions of the world and across all sectors of the economy. ExxonMobil continues to proactively collaborate with governments and organizations to
advance policy and technology development in support of net zero. The Company recognizes and continues to support the important work of the UNFCCC to achieve global participation through the Paris Agreement. The Company also works with major trade
associations and industry groups including the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative and International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association to advance emission reduction policies and best practices and to develop and deploy lower
emission technology. The oil and natural gas sector along with other sectors and governments all have an important role to play in the energy transition.&#160;&#238;&#164;&#149; Why isn&#146;t ExxonMobil investing in existing renewable energy
sources like wind and solar? Although wind and solar will play an important role in the transition to lower-carbon energy sources, new technology advances are required to reduce emissions to levels outlined in 2&#176;C scenarios. ExxonMobil is
undertaking research and development where the need is greatest. The Company is focused on areas where it can make a unique and significant contribution, and where it has deep scientific competencies. In this way, ExxonMobil can make the most
meaningful and expedient contribution to society&#146;s efforts to manage the risks of climate change. The Company&#146;s technology development program focuses on three distinct high-emitting sectors where there are currently limited viable
solutions for broad deployment: commercial transportation, power generation and industrial processes. These sectors represent about 80&#160;percent of current energy-related CO2 emissions and are projected to increase with population growth and
economic development. In transportation, ExxonMobil is making progress in the development of advanced algae and cellulosic liquid biofuels. Because of their energy density, liquid fuel solutions are currently needed for commercial transportation
where battery capacity is an issue for heavy loads and long distances.&#160;In power generation and for industrial processes, the Company is working to make carbon capture and storage technology more economic, to potentially enable wider deployment.
ExxonMobil currently has about 20&#160;percent of the world&#146;s total carbon capture capacity. In the industrial sector, ExxonMobil is developing new processes for refining and chemical facilities to reduce energy use through advanced separations
processes, catalysts and process

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">4/22/2021 Energy &amp; Carbon Summary&#146;s Frequently asked questions | ExxonMobil Further progress in these areas is critical to
reducing emissions and would make a meaningful contribution to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. It should also be noted that ExxonMobil was one of the top purchasers in 2018 of renewable energy, including wind and solar to support its
operations. &#238;&#164;&#149; Why did ExxonMobil establish a new Low Carbon Solutions business and what products or technologies will be commercialized? In 2018, ExxonMobil established a Carbon Capture &amp; Storage (CCS) Venture that was
recently expanded into the new Low Carbon Solutions business with the goal of commercializing its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio. The new business will initially focus on CCS and hydrogen, two of the critical technologies required for
society to achieve the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. The objective is to build on ExxonMobil&#146;s decades of CCS operating experience and CCS-related R&amp;D to help facilitate society&#146;s transition to a lower carbon future at
the lowest possible cost. Over the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion on lower-emission energy solutions, including CCS, with plans to invest at least another $3 billion through 2025.10 ExxonMobil&#146;s investment in
CCS and other low-carbon solutions will be based on opportunity availability and attractiveness. The establishment of the Low Carbon Solutions business coincides with a growing recognition by governments and investors of the importance of CCS and a
developing market for emission-reduction credits, all of which are critical for broad scale commercialization. CCS is also one of the few technologies that could enable some industry sectors to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
including the refining, chemicals, cement and steel sectors. Today, ExxonMobil is the world&#146;s leader in carbon capture, with more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and is the first company to capture more than 120 million tonnes of
CO , the equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 25 million cars.11 2 12 The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity, and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in
the world since the early 1970s.13 ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions will also leverage ExxonMobil&#146;s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role across a number of market
sectors as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system. Other technology focus areas in ExxonMobil&#146;s low carbon portfolio will be added in the future as they mature to commercialization. 1 Reference is made to the first set of NDC
