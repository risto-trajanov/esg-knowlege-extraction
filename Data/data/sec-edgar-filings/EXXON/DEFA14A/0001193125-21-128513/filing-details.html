future results or conditions, including: demand growth and relative energy mix across sources, economic sections and geographic regions; the impacts of waves of COVID-19; the impact of new technologies; production rates and reserve or resource
changes; efficiency gains and cost savings; emission or emission intensity reductions; reductions in flaring; and the results of investments, could differ materially due to, for example, changes in the supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas,
and petroleum and petrochemical products and resulting price impacts; the outcome of exploration and development projects; the outcome of research projects and the ability to scale new technologies on a cost- effective basis; changes in law or
government policy, including drilling regulations, greenhouse gas regulations, carbon taxes or regulations, and international treaties; the actions of competitors and customers; changes in the rates of population growth, economic development, and
migration patterns; trade patterns and the development and enforcement of global, regional and national mandates; military build-ups or conflicts; unexpected technological developments; general economic conditions, including the occurrence and
duration of economic recessions; unforeseen technical or operational difficulties; the pace of regional or global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments or consumers resulting from the pandemic; and other factors
discussed in this report and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil&#8217;s most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. This document is a shareholder requested publication and is purposefully focused on unknown future events. The statements and analysis in
this document represent a good faith effort by the Company to address this request despite significant unknown variables as well as incomplete and, at times, inconsistent market and government policy signals. Energy demand modeling aims to replicate
system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications to limit a great deal of complexity. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an
energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use or inclusion herein is not an

transportation (trucking, aviation and marine) requires fuels with a high energy density that liquid hydrocarbons provide. The need for an energy-dense fuel could make certain alternatives, such as battery power, poorly suited for this sector.
Biofuels, such as those derived from algae, have the potential to be a scalable solution and deliver the required energy density in a liquid form that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions (38) by more than 50 percent compared to today&#8217;s
heavy-duty transportation fuels. ExxonMobil continues to progress research to transform algae and cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels (biofuels) for the transportation sector. Together with Synthetic Genomics Inc., ExxonMobil has improved strains
of algae that use CO&#8322; and sunlight to produce energy-rich bio-oil, which can then potentially be processed at existing refineries, similar to crude oil, into renewable fuels. A key focus is developing novel genetic tools to overcome inherent
inefficiencies in photosynthesis and improve bio-oil production. Needed biology modifications to the algae continue to be progressed, and the project team has demonstrated increased production in outdoor algae ponds. Through key collaborations,
ExxonMobil has also made significant progress that has more than doubled the yield of biodiesel from a variety of cellulosic sugars. Work with the national labs and academic institutions is helping to address the most challenging issues of scale for
cellulosic biofuels and the Company continues to evaluate a wide range of options in this space. In 2020, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year for five years,
starting in 2022. The renewable diesel will be sourced from a refinery acquired by Global Clean Energy that is being repurposed to produce renewable diesel. In addition, the Company has completed a sea trial of ExxonMobil&#8217;s first bio-based

transportation sector. Together with Synthetic Genomics Inc., ExxonMobil has improved strains of algae that use CO&#8322; and sunlight to produce energy-rich bio-oil, which can then potentially be processed at existing refineries, similar to crude
oil, into renewable fuels. A key focus is developing novel genetic tools to overcome inherent inefficiencies in photosynthesis and improve bio-oil production. Needed biology modifications to the algae continue to be progressed, and the project team
has demonstrated increased production in outdoor algae ponds. Through key collaborations, ExxonMobil has also made significant progress that has more than doubled the yield of biodiesel from a variety of cellulosic sugars. Work with the national
labs and academic institutions is helping to address the most challenging issues of scale for cellulosic biofuels and the Company continues to evaluate a wide range of options in this space. In 2020, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Global Clean
Energy Holdings to purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year for five years, starting in 2022. The renewable diesel will be sourced from a refinery acquired by Global Clean Energy that is being repurposed to produce renewable diesel.
In addition, the Company has completed a sea trial of ExxonMobil&#8217;s first bio-based marine fuel, which can provide up to approximately 40 percent CO&#8322; emissions reduction compared to conventional marine fuels. Process development to first

2016 levels. The Company&#8217;s goals included a 15 percent (Net equity, CO -equivalent emissions 2 reduction in methane and a 25 percent reduction in flaring. Both goals were achieved million tonnes per year) through targeted improvements at
facilities in the United States, Equatorial Guinea, Angola and Nigeria, eliminating approximately 6 million tonnes of CO equivalent 2 emissions (CO e). 2 New CCS deployment captured an additional 500,000 tonnes of CO&#8322;e in Australia and Qatar
in 2019. Through the Company&#8217;s energy management systems, including the application of cogeneration, greater than 1 million tonnes of CO&#8322;e were avoided from 2015 through 2020. In 2018, ExxonMobil announced two 12-year agreements with
Lincoln Clean Energy for the purchase of 500 MWs of wind and solar electricity. Sage Draw, the operator of the wind facility, began generating power to the electricity grid in Texas (ERCOT) in December of 2019; and the solar plant is currently
active. Both plants are expected to avoid approximately 800,000 tonnes of CO&#8322; per year by replacing 70 percent of power purchased by the Company from the ERCOT grid with carbon-free power. Additional power purchase agreements are being
evaluated around the world. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has invested over $10 billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions. ExxonMobil also continues to expand collaborative efforts with other companies and academic
institutions. See pages 22 to 29 for more information on these collaborations. ExxonMobil has interests in more than 100 cogeneration facilities around the world, with the latest unit recently completed at Imperial&#8217;s Strathcona refinery in

intensity. The Company also plans to eliminate routine flaring by 2030 in upstream operations, as defined by the World Bank. The 2025 emission reduction plans include actions that are expected to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by an
estimated 30 percent for the Company&#8217;s upstream business. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 40 to 50 percent. ExxonMobil&#8217;s emission reduction plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from

factors can result in quantities being recognized again as proved reserves at some future point, such as a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spend. This can result in proved
