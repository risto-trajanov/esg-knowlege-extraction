equity securities in New Zealand, as well as the Laffan refinery in Qatar, for which results are reported in the Upstream segment. Capacity data is based on 100 percent of rated refinery process unit stream-day capacities under normal operating
conditions, less the impact of shutdowns for regular repair and maintenance activities, averaged over an extended period of time. 2 ExxonMobil share reflects 100 percent of atmospheric distillation capacity in operations of ExxonMobil and
majority-owned subsi diaries. For companies owned 50 percent or less, ExxonMobil share is the greater of ExxonMobil&#8217;s interest or that portion of distillation capacity normally available to ExxonMobil. 3 Includes thermal cracking, visbreaking,

TO TAB LE OF CONTE NT S FREQUENTLY USED TERMS Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil&#8217;s key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and
their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule. Total shareholder return (TSR) &#8226; measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We
calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the
end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are
paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis. Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) &#8226; r epresents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax
basis from the Summary statement of income. exxonmobil&#8217;s c apex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. c apex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of exxonmobil shares used to acquire assets, and
depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While exxonmobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is
placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures. Returns, investment returns, project returns &#8226; Unless referring specifically to r Oce , references to returns, investment returns, project returns, and similar terms
mean future discounted cash flow returns on future capital investments based on current company estimates. investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs. Heavy oil and oil sands &#8226; Heavy oil, for the purpose of this
document, includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum c ongress in 1987 based on American Petroleum institute (APi) gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an APi gravity between 10 and
22.3 degrees. t he APi gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is less than 10 degrees. extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10,000 centipoise, whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10,000 centipoise. t he term &#8220;oil sands&#8221;
is used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation. Leverage &#8226; Leverage is defined as &#8220;net debt/(net debt + market capitalization).&#8221; Project &#8226; t he term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in
this document can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources &#8226; Along with similar terms used
in this document, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. exxonmobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. t
he resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. t he term &#8220;resource
base&#8221; or similar terms are not intended to correspond to Sec definitions such as &#8220;probable&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; reserves. t he term &#8220;in-place&#8221; refers to those quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be

Corporation&#8217;s assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation&#8217;s strategic objectives. Assets are
divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with
cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions. OPERATING COSTS 2020 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Reconciliation of operating costs
