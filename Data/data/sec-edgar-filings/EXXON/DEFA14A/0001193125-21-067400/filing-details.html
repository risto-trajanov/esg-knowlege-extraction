CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. Forward-looking statements contained in this presentation regarding the potential for future earnings, cash flow, margins, ROCE, returns, rate of return, addressable markets, available cash from operations,
operating cash flow, cash operating expenses, net cash margin, free cash, free cash flow, and resource potential are not forecasts of actual future results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future results and goals of
currently-contemplated management plans and objectives including new project investments, plans to replace natural decline in Upstream production with low-cost volumes, plans to increase sales in our Downstream and Chemical segments and to shift our
Downstream product mix toward higher-value products, continued highgrading of ExxonMobil&#8217;s portfolio through our ongoing asset management program, both announced and continuous initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, capital
expenditures and cash management, and other efforts within management&#8217;s control to impact future results as discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#8217;s view of the
potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown, calculated on a basis consistent with our internal modelling assumptions for factors such as working capital, as well as factors management does not control, such as interest, differentials,
and exchange rates. For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices. Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with
management&#8217;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. Downstream and Chemical margins
reflect annual historical averages for the 10-year period from 2010&#8212;2019 unless otherwise stated. These prices are not intended to reflect management&#8217;s forecasts for future prices or the prices we use for internal planning purposes. We
have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to model potential COVID-19
outbreaks or recoveries beyond historical pricing. Unless otherwise indicated, asset sales and proceeds are consistent with our internal planning. For future periods, we have assumed Corporate &amp; Financing expenses between $2.1 and $2.7 billion
annually. To illustrate future financial capacity, we have used scenarios of Corporate &amp; Financing expenses that reflect the estimated potential debt levels under those scenarios. Outlook for Corporate &amp; Financing expenses for the first
quarter 2021 is expected to be approximately $700 million. ExxonMobil-operated emissions, reductions and avoidance performance data are based on a combination of measured and estimated data using best available information. Calculations are based on
industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and IPIECA. The uncertainty associated with the emissions, reductions and avoidance performance data depends on variation in the processes and
operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Changes to the performance data may be reported as updated data and/or emission methodologies become available.
ExxonMobil works with industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and methodologies. Emissions, reductions and avoidance estimates from non- ExxonMobil operated facilities are included in the equity data and similarly may be
updated as changes to the performance data are reported. The data includes XTO Energy performance beginning in 2011. See the Cautionary Statement at the front of this presentation for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

With respect to
historical periods, reconciliation information is provided in the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investor page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources for certain terms used in this presentation including
available cash from operations, operating cash flow, cash operating expense, net cash margin, free cash and free cash flow. For future periods, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP or other measures to the most
comparable GAAP financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are outside management&#8217;s control as described above. Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and
providing a meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable
effort. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted above. DEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE RECONCILIATIONS. Available cash from operations. Available cash from
operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities and (2) net cash used in investing activities, both
from the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (3) capital and exploration expenditures. It includes estimated proceeds from asset sales net of forgone cash flows from divested assets. This measure is useful when evaluating total sources of cash
available, including from equity companies, for uses such as capital and exploration expenditures and financing activities, including debt reduction and shareholder distributions. Cash operating expenses (cash Opex, structural efficiencies, or
structural reductions). Cash operating expenses are a subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management&#8217;s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the
Corporation&#8217;s efforts to optimize cash through disciplined expense management. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of cash operating expenses see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our
website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. Flexible Capex. Flexible Capex includes those investments with minimal costs or value loss to defer expenditures, such as investments in short cycle businesses like
unconventionals, projects that have not commenced or are early in construction and with limited penalty to pause. Less-flexible Capex. Less flexible Capex includes projects conducted for safety, environmental and regulatory reasons, projects already
in execution with penalties or loss of value associated with pausing, and investments made in order to retain rights or options for potential future investment. Free cash. Free cash is operating cash flow less capital investment. This measure is
useful when approximating contributions to cash available for financing activities, applied to the Upstream business. Free cash flow. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations and asset sales less additions to property, plant and equipment, and
additional investments and advances, plus other investing activities, including collection of advances. This measure is useful when evaluating cash available for financing activities, including shareholder distributions, after investment in the
business. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of free cash flow see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. 65SUPPLEMENTAL

RECONCILIATIONS, CONTINUED Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on &#8220;Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C&#8221; and identified 74 scenarios as &#8220;Lower 2&#186;C,&#8221; which are
pathways limiting peak warming to below 2&#186;C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66 percent likelihood. Net cash margin ($/bbl input). Net cash margin, following Solomon Associate&#8217;s definition, is defined as gross margin at a
standard price set for feeds and products, less normalized operating costs on a unit basis, expressed as $/bbl of total input. Operating cash flow. Operating Cash Flow is earnings plus depreciation and depletion, including non-controlling interests
and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, pro-rata equity company earnings are net of depreciation and depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for investment and financing
activities excluding working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. Operating costs (Opex). Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company&#8217;s products for sale &#8211;
including energy, staffing, and maintenance costs. They exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense and are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net
income, operating costs, as defined above, represent the expenses most directly under management&#8217;s control, and therefore are useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management&#8217;s performance. For information
concerning the calculation and reconciliation of operating costs see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. Performance product. Refers to Chemical

in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms,
these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base
includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term &#8220;resource base&#8221; or similar
terms is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as &#8220;probable&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; reserves. The term &#8220;in-place&#8221; refers to those quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be contained in known

ExxonMobil&#8217;s key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute
&#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule.
Total shareholder return (TSR) &#8226; Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the
sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the
beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis. Capital and
exploration expenditures (Capex) &#8226; Represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated statement of income. ExxonMobil&#8217;s Capex includes
its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to
property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil&#8217;s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures. Returns,
rate of return, IRR &#8226; Unless referring specifically to external data, references to returns, rate of return, IRR, and similar terms mean future discounted cash flow returns on future capital investments based on current company estimates.
Investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs. Heavy oil and oil sands &#8226; Heavy oil includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum Congress in 1987 based on American Petroleum Institute
(API) gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an API gravity between 10 and 22.3 degrees. The API gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is less than 10 degrees. Extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10,000 centipoise,
whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10,000 centipoise. The term &#8220;oil sands&#8221; is used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation. Divestments &#8226; Divestments represent the unadjusted
sale price specified in the applicable contract of sale as of the effective date for asset divestiture agreements which the corporation or one of its affiliates has executed since January 1, 2019. Actual final sale price and cash proceeds may differ
in amount and timing from the divestment value depending on applicable contract terms. Leverage &#8226; Leverage is defined as &#8220;net debt/(net debt + market capitalization).&#8221; Project &#8226; The term &#8220;project&#8221; can refer to a
variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Proved reserves &#8226; Proved reserve figures are determined in accordance with SEC definitions. Resources, resource
base, and recoverable resources &#8226; Along with similar terms, refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of
discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately
recoverable. The term &#8220;resource base&#8221; or similar terms are not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as &#8220;probable&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; reserves. The term &#8220;in-place&#8221; refers to those quantities of oil
and natural gas estimated to be contained in known accumulations and includes recoverable and unrecoverable amounts. 1FREQUENTLY USED TERMS Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil&#8217;s key business and financial performance measures

&#8211; net interest are changes to ExxonMobil&#8217;s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a
result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Volume effects &#8226; Entitlements &#8211; price, spend and other
are changes to ExxonMobil&#8217;s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume- determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another.
According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated
by specific provisions in production agreements. Volume effects &#8226; Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil&#8217;s sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a
sector, type, or method of production. Volume effects &#8226; Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil&#8217;s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. Volume effects &#8226; Growth and other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are
not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements. 2Frequently Used Terms, continued Volume effects &#8226; Entitlements &#8211; net interest are changes to ExxonMobil&#8217;s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors

regular disciplined review process to ensure all assets are contributing to the Corporation&#8217;s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the
regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities, including shareholder distributions. 3Frequently Used Terms, continued CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES 2020 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Net cash provided by operating activities 14,668 29,716 36,014 Proceeds associated with
