Disclosures 24 Footnotes COVER PHOTO: ExxonMobil has established an enhanced management program to reduce methane emissions. Further details can be found on page 17. Statements of future events or conditions in this report, including projections,
targets, expectations, estimates, and business plans, are forward-looking statements. Actual future results or conditions, including demand growth and energy source mix; the impact of new technologies; production rates and reserve growth; efficiency
gains and cost savings; emission reductions; and results of investments could differ materially due to, for example, changes in the supply in and demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum and petrochemical products and resulting price
impacts; the outcome of exploration and development projects; the outcome of research projects and ability to scale new technologies on a cost-effective basis; changes in law or government policy, including environmental regulations and
international treaties; the actions of competitors and customers; changes in the rates of population growth and economic development; unexpected technological developments; general economic conditions, including the occurrence and duration of
economic recessions; unforeseen technical difficulties; and other factors discussed in this report and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil&#146;s most recent Form 10-K. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs
of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil. References to &#147;resources&#148;, &#147;resource base,&#148; and similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves under SEC definitions but that we believe
will ultimately be produced. For additional information see the &#147;Frequently Used Terms&#148; on the Investors page of our website at exxonmobil.com. References to &#147;oil&#148; and &#147;gas&#148; include crude, natural gas liquids, bitumen,
synthetic oil, and natural gas. Prior years&#146; data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2016 presentation basis. The term &#147;project&#148; as used in this publication can refer to a variety of different activities and
does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. </font></p>

Protection Agency as well as industry affiliates including ExxonMobil. https://emf.stanford.edu/industry-affiliates (8) To understand some of the characteristics of future transition pathways, we analyzed energy and emissions data from a range of
EMF27 stabilization, policy and technology targets, primarily focusing on 450 and 550 stabilization targets, as well as no-policy cases that utilize a full suite of technologies. The suite of full technologies (FT) includes a range of options,
including: energy efficiency, nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS), biofuels and non-bio renewables such as solar and wind. The EMF27 study considered other technology-limited scenarios, but a key finding was that the unavailability of carbon
capture and storage and limited availability of bioenergy had a large impact on feasibility and cost. Given the potential advantages to society of utilizing all available technology options, we focused on capturing the results of different EMF27
models that ran 450-FT cases; we were able to 24 </font></p>

(10)&#160;IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis assessed in its Table SPM.2 that temperature increased from the period of 1850-1900 to the period 1986-2005 by 0.61&#176;C, and that the mean CMIP5 model temperature projection of
RCP 4.5 increased from the period 1986-2005 to the period 2081-2100 by an additional 1.8&#176;C, giving a total increase of 2.4&#176;C from the period of 1850-1900 to the period of 2081-2100. (11) The Assessed 2&#176;C Scenarios produce a variety of
views on the potential impacts on global energy demand in total and by specific types of energy, with a range of possible growth rates for each type of energy as illustrated in this report. Since it is impossible to know which elements, if any, of
these models are correct, we used an average of all 13 scenarios to approximate growth rates for various energy types as a means to estimate trends to 2040 indicative of hypothetical 2&#176;C pathways. (12)&#160;Based on the average of the Assessed
2&#176;C Scenarios referenced in this report, the combination of renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels using CCS is estimated in these scenarios to increase significantly as a percentage of total primary energy demand, rising from approximately 10% in
2010 to roughly 40% in 2040. (13) Total electricity delivered as a percentage of total final energy demand increases from 18% to 28% on average across the 13 Assessed 2&#176;C Scenarios referenced in this report. (14)&#160;Under the Assessed 2&#176;C
Scenarios, the average growth rate for oil demand is <font style="white-space:nowrap">-0.36%</font> from 2010 to 2040, which implies a decrease in absolute level of demand in 2040 by ~10% relative to 2010 levels, which is near 2000 levels. Oil
demand has increased about 9% since 2010, hence it would require a demand decrease of ~20% to reach the same 2040 level relative to today&#146;s demand. Trends toward a level close to 2000 would imply oil used in road transportation trends toward 30
Moebd, and oil used for aviation and marine trends toward 9 Moebd. (15)&#160;Electricity delivered from fossil fuels without CCS as a percentage of total electricity delivered decreases from 66% to 20% on average from 2010 to 2040 under the Assessed
2&#176;C Scenarios. Share of electricity from <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-bioenergy</font> renewables (e.g. wind, solar, hydro) increases from less than 20% to ~35%. Share of electricity generation utilizing CCS increases to about 20%. Share
of electricity from nuclear increases from ~15% to ~20% (implies double the level of nuclear capacity from 2016 to 900 GW). (16) Based on average global demand growth rates under Assessed 2&#176;C Scenarios. (17)&#160;Based on average global demand

reported in the Corporation&#146;s Annual Report on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</font> Proved oil and gas reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements. Proved reserves are those
quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves
are determined using the average of <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">first-of-month</font></font> oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. (19)&#160;For the purposes of this disclosure, resources are
total remaining estimated quantities of discovered quantities of oil and gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The resource base includes proved reserves and quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves. At <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> 2016, the total resource base totaled approximately 91&#160;billion of <font style="white-space:nowrap">oil-equivalent</font> barrels including 20&#160;billion
<font style="white-space:nowrap">oil-equivalent</font> barrels of proved reserves. (20)&#160;To estimate global demand in 2040 for oil and natural gas, the average of the Assessed 2&#176;C Scenarios&#146; growth rates for oil and natural gas covering
the period 2010-2040 have been applied to standard baseline estimates of oil and natural gas demand in 2010. (21) IHS: Climate-Related Financial Risk and the Oil and Gas Sector, page 23. (22) The Assessed 2&#176;C Scenarios growth rates imply a range
in 2040 global oil demand from about 53 to 103 Moebd and for 2040 global natural gas demand from about 265 to 625 Bcfd. (23)&#160;IEA: World Energy Outlook 2017. (24) Hypothetical cumulative production determined by proportioning ExxonMobil&#146;s

value of property, plant and equipment&#148; is calculated by taking the PPE carrying value of ExxonMobil&#146;s resource base and subtracting from it the PPE carrying values of ExxonMobil&#146;s proved reserves, its producing assets that do not
currently meet the SEC&#146;s definition of proved reserves, its unconventional liquids assets and its natural gas assets, and comparing this resulting value against ExxonMobil&#146;s total PPE carrying value as of September&#160;30, 2017. (27)
