<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today&#146;s call
is being recorded. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At this time I&#146;d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary,
Mr.&#160;Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stephen Littleton: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our
Fourth Quarter Earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Before getting started, I hope all of you on the call, your families and your
colleagues are safe in light of the continuing challenges we face as the result of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I am pleased to welcome
Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of ExxonMobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives on 2020 and updates on our
priorities and plans for 2021 and beyond. Following those remarks, Darren and I will be happy to address questions. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our comments this
morning will reference the slides available on the Investor section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I&#146;ll now
highlight developments since the third quarter of this year on the next slide. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the Upstream, gas realizations increased by
approximately 40% with demand and prices recovering from lows earlier in 2020, reflecting the impact of supply disruptions, colder weather and crude-linked LNG pricing. Liquids realizations were essentially flat with third quarter with low October
prices improving as the quarter progressed. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 1 </p>

<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While there were no economic curtailments in the quarter, government-mandated curtailments
increased to approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, the Upstream business matched its best-ever reliability performance for the year. We continue to progress active
exploration programs in Guyana and Brazil, and in the fourth quarter announced a hydrocarbon discovery in Suriname which extends ExxonMobil&#146;s resource position in South America. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the Downstream, we achieved the best-ever personnel and process safety as well as record reliability performance for the year. Industry
refining margins remained at historic lows, driving industry rationalization with four times the <font style="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</font> average level of capacity reductions announced in 2020. With continuing weak margins, we expect further
industry closures. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Chemical business matched the strong operational performance of the Upstream and Downstream, also achieving
best-ever annual safety and reliability performance. This excellent performance enabled us to fully capture the improving margins, driven by sustained strength in packaging and continued recovery in automotive and durable product markets. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Across the corporation, we exceeded the operating cost and CAPEX reduction targets that we laid out in April. We decisively responded to the
unprecedented market conditions in 2020. Leveraging our Global Projects organization, we were able to defer spend and optimize projects to preserve the long-term value of our industry-leading investment portfolio. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s move to Slide 4 for an overview of fourth quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of fourth quarter results relative
to the third quarter. Starting with third quarter 2020, the reported loss of $700&#160;million included favorable identified items of $100&#160;million, driven by the non- cash inventory adjustments we noted in the third quarter. Excluding these
items, the third quarter loss was $800&#160;million. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 2 </p>

<p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">
</p><hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>
<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fourth quarter results were a loss of $20.1&#160;billion, including $20.2&#160;billion of
identified items related to impairments. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $100&#160;million, a $900&#160;million improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were $200&#160;million lower than the third quarter due to <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</font></font> impacts on unsettled derivatives. This reflects the impact of marking to market open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy has not
closed at the end of the quarter. We expect to realize the full earnings of these trading strategies when they close in the future. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Improvements in upstream natural gas and LNG prices, as well as increased liquids production in Guyana, also benefited earnings. Continued
strong demand for high value Chemical performance products, coupled with the strong reliability, supported Chemical earnings improvement of $200&#160;million. Finally as a result of the growing strength of our portfolio, we removed less strategic
assets from our development plans, including certain dry gas resources, notably in North America. This resulted in a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</font> <font style="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</font> impairment charge of about
$19&#160;billion. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the next slides I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying
business performance, excluding identified items. Moving to Slide 5. Improved prices and margins in the Upstream and Chemical increased earnings by $530&#160;million. The benefit of higher upstream liquids production in Guyana, Canada and the US
also improved earnings. This was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of planned turnaround, maintenance and exploration activity. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the Downstream and Chemical our integrated manufacturing sites allowed us to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions and capture
significant feedstock benefits. For example, we optimized units that typically produce gasoline to increase production of high-value chemical feedstocks critical to the manufacturing of gowns, masks and hand sanitizer. Manufacturing results in the
Downstream were improved with strong reliability and investments that high-grade product yields, contributing $160&#160;million to the fourth quarter earnings. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the next slides I will cover a brief summary of the full-year results. Slide 6 is a
comparison of full-year 2020 results relative to 2019. Results reflected the unprecedented loss in demand driven by the economic impact of COVID, which in turn significantly depressed Upstream and Downstream margins. In responding to
pandemic-related challenges, the organization rapidly reduced costs, achieving $3&#160;billion in structural savings out of a total reduction of $8&#160;billion. Our manufacturing facilities contributed an additional $1&#160;billion with better
reliability and improved product yields. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moving to Upstream volumes on Slide 7. Upstream volumes decreased by an average of approximately
190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2019. Volumes were impacted by economic and government-mandated curtailments as well as Groningen production limits which in total reduced volumes by approximately 210,000 oil equivalent barrels per
day. Excluding the impact of economic and government-mandated curtailments, entitlements, Groningen production limits and divestments, volumes increased by about 110,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. This was in line with our original production
plans with optimization of maintenance activity reducing the impact of economic curtailments. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moving to Slide 8. In April we set a target
to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15% and CAPEX by 30%. We exceeded these reduction targets. Looking at capital spending, we established reductions of 30%. The reorganization of our Upstream and Downstream businesses a couple years ago
enabled us to accelerate the efficiency capture that we expected from these changes. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cash operating expenses were down $8&#160;billion versus 2019, including structural
reductions of about $3&#160;billion that were delivered through optimization of supply chains and logistics, work process simplification and workforce reductions. We leveraged our new Global Projects organization and strong relationships with EPCs
to adjust our capital plan, deferring spend and further optimizing projects. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This allowed us to reduce quarterly spend by $2&#160;billion
in the second quarter versus the first quarter, a 25% reduction. As we continued this work through the year, we reduced capital expenditures by $10&#160;billion, or greater than 30% versus 2019 and the original plan. Importantly, we did this while
improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s turn to the next page where you can see the
impact of these reductions on our cash profile. Excluding the impact of working capital effects, fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $600&#160;million from the third quarter. Gross debt decreased by about $1.2&#160;billion to
$67.6&#160;billion. We ended the quarter with $4.4&#160;billion of cash, a little above our minimum operating levels. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Turning to Slide 10,
I&#146;ll cover a few key considerations for the first quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels from
the fourth quarter. Production is expected to be higher in the first quarter due to seasonal gas demand. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the Downstream, we anticipate
higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds to be offset by additional efficiencies. In Chemical, we anticipate continued demand resilience across packaging, hygiene and medical segments with continuing recovery in automotive and construction
markets. Scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter. Corporate and finance expenses are anticipated to be about $700&#160;million. Lastly, at current crude prices and Downstream and Chemical margins, we expect cash flow from
operating activities to cover the dividend and our planned CAPEX which has flexibility to adjust depending on the business environment. </p>

healthy. I&#146;m sure I&#146;m like many of you: happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead. As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially
severe in our industry. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Energy consumption collapsed as economies shut down, oil prices hit their lowest point in history and refining
margins fell well below their <font style="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</font> lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses. As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times
was primarily focused on three areas: protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products, and aggressively reducing spend while
preserving value to ensure we remained in the best possible position for the eventual recovery. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re pleased with how we performed
on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products, from hand sanitizer to specialty products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts we kept operations
running 24/7 while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the same time, we leveraged on the ongoing
work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce cost and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment. We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised
plan, which we shared with you in April. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Going forward, we&#146;re continuing to work to reduce cost by leveraging synergies from
aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce cost to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend
and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ll provide more detail momentarily on the successful
efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I&#146;ll also spend time discussing the significant steps we&#146;ve taken to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to
advance lower emission technologies like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me start though by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 in what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of
unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products while achieving best ever safety and reliability performance. We reduced cash operating expenses by
more than 15%, including $3&#160;billion of structural improvements, and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21&#160;billion without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring, and established new plans for 2025, that are projected to be
consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Permian Basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, despite curtailments and reduced investment. This
performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth in demand for performance packaging and strong operating
performance of our expanding asset fleet. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we&#146;ve held for more
than 30 years, by increasing sequestered CO2 to more than 120&#160;million tonnes. This is well over twice the closest competitor and larger than the next five competitors combined. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To put this in perspective, 120&#160;million tonnes is equivalent to taking more than 25&#160;million passenger vehicles off the road in a
year. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our
corporation to progress an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities critical to the long-term success of the company. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness, and position ourselves amongst the industry&#146;s lowest <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">cost-of-supply.</font></font> </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me start with our efficiencies. You may
recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along their value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">end-to-end</font></font> oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work, and focus on the highest value activities. </p>

to fully leverage the Corporation&#146;s scale, further reducing cost and improving effectiveness. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Global Projects organization was
established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each project and when necessary cost effectively deferring work. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we came into 2020 and the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses.
Expense results are shown on this chart, which is consistent with the chart Stephen showed, excluding production taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As you can see, 60% of the $5&#160;billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational
efficiencies. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During last year&#146;s planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert short-term or temporary expense reductions into
permanent structural efficiencies. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This year we expect to achieve a further $1&#160;billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023 we will
achieve a total of $6&#160;billion in structural expense reductions vs. 2019. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of

independent of the price environment we find ourselves in. On the other hand, the returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 to 2023 are in large part a function of the price environment. In lower-price environments, much of that
increase would be further deferred. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I may now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have

driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we entered 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflect three
key themes: value, flexibility, and discipline. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Value derived from advancing our highest return, cashflow accretive projects to deliver
increased earnings in cash, both near- and long-term. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Flexibility to respond to a dynamic market. We demonstrated this in 2020 and have

</p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In each planned year we have a level of short cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also
expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These too can be deferred or suspended. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Less flexible spend can also be reduced, but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed, or very near

move right, you see our uses, the current dividend, and our 2021 CAPEX from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. </p>

10 year historical range, we can fund our highest return investments in Guyana, the Permian, and Chemical business, and begin paying down debt at Brent prices just above $50 a barrel. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10 year averages, Brent break even prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would
allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend, and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we look at the market year to

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obviously, we are very early into the year, and we know the market will change. We&#146;re keeping a close eye on developments and will adjust

as you can see, our plan&#146;s robust to a wide range of price environments. And while we&#146;re optimistic that the recent improvements to the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next 4 to 5 years. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we face a year where Brent prices remain below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this. </p>

responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the <font style="white-space:nowrap">mid-</font> to long-term generates the greatest value. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of course an investment portfolio of industry advantage projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are
making in developing upstream resources, which represent the majority of our upstream capital spend. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This chart graphs cumulative Upstream
capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we&#146;ve deemed our cost of supply. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As you can see, our focus on high return, lowest cost of supply investments, generate a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $40 a
barrel. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing upstream resources have a cost of supply of $35 per barrel or less. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These investments generate an average return, using third party price outlooks, in excess of 30%. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So as you can see, striking the right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments, while maintaining our strong dividend
and fortifying the balance sheet to <font style="white-space:nowrap">de-lever,</font> is essential in maximizing value, both near-term and long-term. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When executed in a period where others are pulling back and construction markets are slack,
these investments become even more attractive. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When you factor in the flexibility of our short-cycle investments in the Permian, where the
value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we have been making in the Permian. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite challenging conditions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and expectations. These
improvements reflect the hard work of our people, the organizational changes made in 2019, and the continued evolution of our technology and our techniques. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology, and project organizations, with the unconventional operating
organization. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our plan and more than 20% better than a full year of 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were
15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate that roughly 2/3rds of the savings were due to improved
performance. As an example, the number of frac stations achieved in a day increased by 30% vs. 2019. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 15 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further
growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite
significant economic curtailments in the 2nd quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, exceeded our plan. They were about 100,000 oil equivalent per day above 2019. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Going forward, with the pandemic-related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain
positive free cash flow, deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and achieve double digit returns at less than $35 a barrel. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on
the current market price projections, our plans result in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If demand and prices are lower than current third party outlooks, we&#146;ll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through
2025, we would expect to deliver an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 vs. 2020 production levels. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The key point
here is that we have flexibility and options, which I expect to improve with time. We&#146;ve been making significant progress on our Technology Programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making I expect
continued improvements in productivity growing volumes at even lower cost. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our
investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities amid an uncertain market outlook. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;d like to move onto the results we&#146;ve achieved in lowering our emissions and the
plans we have for further reductions. But before I do, I&#146;d like to recap some key points. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our portfolio offers the best collection of
investment opportunities we&#146;ve had in over 20 years. We have some of the industry&#146;s lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices. Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our Capital Program through 2025
improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long-term. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Leveraging our experience from
2020, we&#146;ve built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our plan basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the
right balance, growing value, maintaining a strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is <font style="white-space:nowrap">de-levered</font> over time. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s turn to our work and position the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of
society&#146;s biggest challenges requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses, and consumers. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions and the emissions of our
customers. Today, we remain committed to this with plans to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its inception, we have
supported the goals of the Paris Agreement engaging in climate related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement, we reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year we met the reduction
objectives we set in 2018 and, in the fourth quarter, announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 17 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our plans reduce emissions from operating assets and align the company with the World
Bank&#146;s initiative to eliminate routine flaring, they reduce the intensity of our operated upstream greenhouse gas emissions, and drive a decreased in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute
upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30%, and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
plans continue to invest in lower emission initiatives with an expected spend of more than $500&#160;million a year. This includes energy efficiency, CCS investments, cogeneration, research and development, and renewable purchases, an area where we
already make a significant contribution. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and
among the top 5% across all corporations purchasing roughly 600 Megawatts. While we don&#146;t bring is significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world scale developments with purchase
contracts helping to ensure they are built. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re also the world&#146;s leader in carbon capture responsible for over 40% of the CO2
captured. To put this into context, the Nature Conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to &#147;plant a billion trees&#148;. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re also one of the world&#146;s largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are
well positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil
Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. </p>

long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we&#146;ve already made. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As you can see in this
chart, since the inception of the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions down 6%, significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. Over the past 20 years, we have invested
more than $10&#160;billion to research, develop, and deploy lower emission&#146;s energy solutions resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480&#160;million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which is
equivalent to the annual emissions of 100&#160;million cars. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The plans we announced in December further reduce the intensity of our
businesses delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at
operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leveraged this process and built into additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other plan objectives, the performance of our businesses and our
senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think it&#146;s important to point out that our plans are in
line with the stated ambitions of the Paris Agreement, which you can see on the next chart. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil
emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris Agreement, hypothetical 1.5 degree and 2 degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both
ExxonMobil and society at large. Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There&#146;s a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris Emissions shown by the green
diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories&#146; Nationally Determined Contributions. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are working to close this gap and help
provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&amp;D is focused on the world&#146;s highest emitting sectors, manufacturing, commercial transportation, and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy related carbon
emissions and where today&#146;s alternatives are insufficient. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than
$3&#160;billion in lower-emission initiatives, which include energy efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement.
</p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficult to decarbonize sectors. It is also
generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. In the 2 degree scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change it is estimated that in 2040 10% of total energy will require CCS. It is
also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a
significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that society&#146;s cost of achieving a 2 degree outcome would more than double increasing the cost by 138%. </p>

action and innovation in carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ExxonMobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there&#146;s an opportunity to leverage our deep
operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise, and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area. In 2018, we formed a Carbon Capture Venture to identify and develop potential
CCS opportunities using both established and emerging technologies. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This group has been working with governments, industry, academia, and

other commercial opportunities from our extensive low carbon technology portfolio. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The business will focus its efforts on solutions

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: But with respect to your comment and the delivery of some of
the improvements we&#146;ve made, I&#146;ll just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on, you know, the journey we&#146;ve been on. As we looked at the business and focused on the opportunities to improve performance over time we
recognized the need as a capital intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on and continue to recognize, advised&#133; of that opportunity and the
leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so as you heard, you know, early on with my tenure that was a focus.
We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring to move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time of the merger of Exxon and Mobil, which
served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those two companies together but with time, recognized the need to move to an organization that had a better line of sight <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">end-to-end</font></font> on the business and more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I think, you know, last year in the March Analyst Meeting I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to
drive efficiencies. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I would say 2020 delivered on that and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunities down the
road. And have actually built into our plans from 2020, these improved efficiencies. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that&#146;s what I would tell you is the
foundation of the plan that we&#146;ve got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward independent of, you know, where the market takes us. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 24 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call, with where,
you know, the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that that had to be a temporary downturn just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry and wanted to make sure that we
prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery, recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I would say, as we
sit here today, I would still characterize it as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months, but we haven&#146;t, we&#146;re not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak. We&#146;re prepared and keeping an eye on
how the market develops and we will respond accordingly. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, I feel good about where we&#146;re at today, I think we&#146;ve got our
company in a position and our organization focused on the right things and then we&#146;ve got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward. And as I said, </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doug Terreson: Okay. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: As I look at the first quarter, we&#146;re ahead of where we thought we were going to be. And we&#146;ll all
start to <font style="white-space:nowrap">de-lever</font> and continue to progress our investments. So, I feel as good as you can, given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doug Terreson: Yeah, and then Darren, you guys may be the most asset rich company in our sector and you know, last year was
kind of an impossible year to even think about selling assets, probably. But you have a lot to work with and so spend a minute on that, too, on divestitures and progressing that plan. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 25 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Right. I think, as you saw last year, we&#146;ve been talking
about, we&#146;re really trying to focus the activity on the highest value, highest return, lowest cost of capital that which has meant prioritizing investments and high-grading the portfolio. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, we announced a divestment program, something that we had historically not done and have been out prosecuting that divestment program. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doug Terreson: Okay. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: We&#146;ve got assets in the market today. But as we said, at the time we announced it, it continues to be the
underlying principle associated with our divestment program. It&#146;s a value-driven program. So, we&#146;re looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the asset, sees more opportunities than we can prosecute with the asset. So that
is what drives the decision. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obviously, last year with all the uncertainty, there wasn&#146;t a whole lot of activity in this space,
although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty and that&#146;s going to continue on. And I would say, as the market recovers and people&#146;s views develop more
fully, I expect we&#146;ll have additional advancements in that program. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doug Terreson: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neil Mehta: Good morning, guys. And thank you, for the incremental
disclosure, lots of interesting stuff to unpack. I guess the first question is, I just wanted to confirm, did you say you expect to be on the low end of the $16 to $19&#160;billion band this year? </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then the follow up around that is you&#146;re at $67.6&#160;billion of gross debt. Is there an absolute level that you guys are gunning for
here, when it comes to your gross debt level? </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Good morning, Neil. Yeah, I will confirm that was the
comment I made. I do expect to be on the lower end of that range. And then our plan with respect to debt is, you know, we talked about in the third quarter, we kind of set a hard limit of around $70&#160;billion. We didn&#146;t want to go above that
and working hard to bring that down, expect for that to come down in the first quarter. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then we&#146;ll continue to work to bring that
down, to really rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. It is one of the three capital allocation priorities and we think it&#146;s absolutely critical to underpin the business we&#146;ve got going forward and to ride through the cycles that we
face. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And clearly 2020 was a very deep down cycle, one that, frankly, we&#146;ve never seen before and I&#146;m pleased that the capital
structure we had in place and our ability to respond to that unprecedented market environment was very successful. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We leveraged the use of
the balance sheet, obviously and we&#146;re now going to rebuild that to have the capacity we need to continue to weather the ups and downs of the cycles that we know will happen as we go forward. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neil Mehta: Thanks, Darren. And the follow up is just your perspective on M&amp;A. I guess, last year was a busy one in terms
of incremental (M&amp;A) deals. Just how does Exxon think about the M&amp;A landscape, the bid/ask right now and, you know, certainly the super major cycle that we saw in the late 1990s, early 2000s created a lot of value. There were some press
speculation on that and I&#146;m not sure what you can say. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But conceptually, do you see the potential for major consolidation or is that too difficult
to execute, given all the challenges of consummating that type of deal? </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes, sure Neil. I&#146;m obviously
not going to comment on speculation in the press. But what I would say is the approach that we take in this space has been pretty consistent and we&#146;ve talked about that over the years. And it&#146;s really looking for value opportunities where
there&#146;s another company that we can leverage synergies, leverage differences in portfolios that basically complement one another. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
look at a lot of things in that whole space. We&#146;ve been active in that for quite some time. We continue to be active to look for opportunities to grow value, unique value, and that&#146;s kind of what drives in our mind, the opportunity. And as
you know, we&#146;ve talked about in the past, haven&#146;t always haven&#146;t found opportunities that we felt were valued correctly, or valued in line with what would be required to kind of extract unique value through an acquisition or a merger,
but we continue to look in that space, and it will be an active program going forward. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stephen Littleton: And if you
don&#146;t mind, I probably add the other thing that we look at Neil, is the fact it has to compete against our existing portfolio of projects, which is industry-leading best. So, when we look at any type of potential acquisition will look compared
relative to some of our other investment opportunities, notably in the Upstream and Chemical space. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neil Mehta: Thank you, Darren. </p>

the <font style="white-space:nowrap">800-pound</font> gorilla in the room, which is obviously the criticism that&#146;s been leveled at you and the management team by activists. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I want to ask specifically to how Exxon is responding to the latest disclosure, for example, in carbon capture and your emissions reductions
your demonstrable capital flexibility, are all something that perhaps has been overlooked in the past, I wonder if you could speak to how you&#146;re looking to address that and I&#146;ve got a follow up, please. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Sure. Well, good morning, Doug, and Happy New Year to you as well. What I&#146;d say is, you know, last year,
clearly was an unprecedented event, something that, you know, forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and in our company. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as we use &#151; leverage the new organization and you know, reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of
that, we changed a lot of things and, you know, operating under a new set of constraints, obviously drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did require a different approach going forward and so, that was the focus and rebuilding the
plans for 2020. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, as I&#146;ve said, I think the organization as a whole responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not
only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time putting together a very thorough, well <font style="white-space:nowrap">thought-out</font> plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the

and our past plans and wanted to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So, we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming
into this call, and more thoroughly, taking the investment community through more details of that plan and that&#146;s what we&#146;ve been doing here. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All the things we&#146;ve talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it, and it&#146;s work that has been
underway for quite some time and I&#146;d say 2020, a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of
<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">up-to-date</font></font> with those plans, given the constraints that we&#146;re operating under. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doug Leggate: I realize it&#146;s not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the clarity. But let me just pick up on one
issue as my follow up, and it&#146;s on capital flexibility and the dividend. Because it seems you&#146;re, I don&#146;t want to say unequivocal, but you&#146;re certainly providing a good deal of emphasis on the sustainability of the dividend. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, I wonder if you could just speak to that and in your answer maybe talk to the inflection in
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-productive</font> capital, because you have spent a ton of money on things that it seems you&#146;re just about to get to that inflection, which can support that perception of dividend surety. So, I wonder if you
could just address those issues and how we get there. Thank you. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Sure. Yeah, I think &#151; so we&#146;ve
built the plan based on you know the three capital allocation priorities that I touched on as part of my prepared remarks, and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing as you look at the portfolio, and the underlying strategy that
we embarked on back in 2017&#151;2018 timeframe, that remains in place. </p>

we have in the portfolio continue to look attractive in this environment and you saw, you know, the upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend to show that. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environment, and we&#146;ve structured the
capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year, and the drawdown that we had in capital, to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust. If you think about what we&#146;ve put in that flexible bucket, there&#146;s a
large chunk of or, you know, piece of short-term, the short cycle investments in the Permian, where we clearly have flexibility. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve got paced projects, the things that our Global Projects organization and we&#146;re working to
<font style="white-space:nowrap">re-optimize</font> the capital program. I think very cost effectively and working with our EPC partners suspended some of those projects but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back up again,
that&#146;s in our flexible spending. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as I mentioned, we&#146;ve got some longer term spend to fill the pipeline early on, so that
we&#146;ve got things that we move outside the plan. So, all those things are kind of we can make decisions in real time about whether we continue to progress those or pull back in that area, depending on what the environment&#146;s at. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And because we can do that, and as we pointed out in this, the charts that we&#146;ve shown, we&#146;ve got lots of flexibility under different
price environments to sustain the dividend. So, we feel really good about where we&#146;re at today, that we&#146;ve got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow, as I&#146;ve showed, but at the same time, if we need to, and the environment
dictates we can pull back. I think that&#146;s the optimal position is to develop options, to have the flexibility to adjust if you need to. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phil Gresh: So, first question, and perhaps it&#146;s a signal of the times, but the charts around your flexibility only take
the oil price up to $55 at this point, which is notable considering we&#146;re at $58 now. So, I&#146;m curious, you know, is this message today, one where we&#146;re supposed to be taking it as like an official cap on the capital spending long term
in the $20 to $25&#160;billion range, such that any additional cash flow and in an upside case would be fully committed to debt reduction? </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You did mention shareholder distributions in one of those slides as well, so just any incremental thoughts there. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Sure, Phil, I you know, I kind of come back to we don&#146;t
know where prices are going to go. And I think you know, we have not tried to build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead, what we&#146;ve tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And when I say reasonable, we test our price basis against kind of third party and where the market generally the market is and our expectation
is to be kind of on and you know, within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations and that&#146;s how we build the plans. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But we recognize when we put that together, that those prices probably aren&#146;t going to materialize and could be higher or lower and sort
to have flexibility and I wouldn&#146;t read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean, it was it&#146;s kind of just it was a number that we picked. The higher it goes, the better off, obviously where we&#146;re at. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I would tell you our first priority above and beyond the plan, if we see a price environment that&#146;s higher than we have anticipated,
it would be to continue to <font style="white-space:nowrap">de-lever</font> and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again, I would tell you, you know, and as I&#146;ve talked about today, and in the past, you know, balancing across
the three cap allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short term. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Last year when we
recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritized the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet, as we come out of that which is what we expected, our plan is
to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb whatever shocks come in the future. </p>

accretive projects because ultimately they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation. So I&#146;d say the keyword as we work through last year is balance. And I&#146;d say the other one is optionality and flexibility and
that&#146;s what the plan now reflects and what we talk about today. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phil Gresh: Okay got it. My <font style="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</font> question would be around Slide 30 in your commentary about how the first quarter is shaping up. Obviously, on this slide the only area where the margins are well below the low end of the range is
Downstream. And, you know, based on your long history in that business and how you&#146;re seeing things today specifically for Downstream, would you say that the margins right now are consistent with the low end of the range and kind of the
$3&#160;billion annualized uplift that you&#146;re talking about? </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I recognize you&#146;ve made a comment that in totality you&#146;re
there but I&#146;m, you know, specifically thinking more about the Downstream. Thank you. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes well you can
see on the Downstream in that Chart 30 we&#146;ve put a kind of a January estimate in there so kind of where we are at currently and it&#146;s still well outside that historic range. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I think, you know, today if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe where margins are at, it&#146;s not a sustainable
position just because of the losses that are accruing. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, you know, you look back in history I think there&#146;s a certain physics
associated with these businesses to say you can only go so low before you&#146;re not covering your cost and you&#146;re bleeding cash and so you&#146;re going to have to make adjustments. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And that historical range in my mind kind of sets those limits. I mean these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below
the marginal cost of supply it&#146;s going to end up costing the industry as a whole and eventually players will rationalize and dropout. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 34 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And that, you know, for as long as I&#146;ve been in the Downstream that business has been
long supply and it&#146;s a slow process to rationalize, the type particularly as more refineries come on, you know, out in Asia. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I
think it&#146;s just what you&#146;re seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply-demand balance. And obviously demand is off pretty significantly what was already kind of a marginally long business. So
it&#146;ll be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then continued rationalization. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As Stephen said, you
know, we&#146;ve seen last year, you know, much higher levels of rationalization. And my expectation would be if we don&#146;t see the margins, you know, recover back to within that band that you&#146;ll continue to see that. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phil Gresh: And do you think we&#146;ll get there in 2021 towards the low end at some point? </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: I think it&#146;s very dependent upon how the recovery goes, how the economy has picked back up again. I think,
you know, it&#146;s&#151;there&#146;s a mixed view. And we&#146;ve tried to be pretty conservative in our planning just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market. We, you know, that&#146;s going to take time. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half but exactly where we end up on that bar, I think
it&#146;s tough to tell. I think eventually we&#146;ll get back there if not, you know, back end of this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection so to speak as demand continues to pick up. And with the reduced supply, you
know, we&#146;ll see that tightness in the supply demand market play itself out Downstream is what I would expect. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The challenge with all
these things&#133;and I&#146;m talking about very fundamental things it&#146;s not a question of if that&#146;s going to happen but when. And I think, you know, that&#146;s I think the trick in this game in our view is, you know, you should
recognize it&#146;s coming but not build a plan based on the hope that it does. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Jon Rigby: Thank you. Thank you Darren for taking the questions. The first one is on the announcement around CCS. I mean it
seems to me is that you&#146;ve taken your time to step into it, it is a considered one and I guess that it must be based at least with a view that there&#146;s a prospect of a business there. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so my question was what do you think has to happen or are you able to describe some of the steps that have to happen both technologically
and then regulatory, fiscally to get us from where we are now to something that looks like a genuine business opportunity? </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And the second
question - I ask the <font style="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</font> as well at the same time. Just on CAPEX is it fair to characterize the level of CAPEX that you need to address one of those three objectives that you have which is to sustain the
dividend over the very long term but CAPEX needs to be in that 21 to 25 and that the current level of spend that you&#146;re projecting for &#145;21 is more around about protecting the balance sheets and therefore not a sustainable level of CAPEX in
the long-term consistent with your <font style="white-space:nowrap">pay-out?</font> Thanks. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes sure Jon.
So on the CCS, I think as I indicated and as I&#146;ve talked I think for as long as I&#146;ve been publicly speaking about this is we&#146;ve recognized that carbon capture storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of the Paris
Agreement. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 36 </p>

<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, you know, one of the things that we&#146;ve noticed over time is and I think the IEA
described it as Momentum in this space is that we&#146;re beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time has recognized but I think, you know, more broadly it&#146;s being recognized
as an important part of the solutions but that in terms of achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So we&#146;ve been working for
quite some time on the technology in trying to address the cost side of that to find a technology that was lower cost which would then make the opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so a lot of work over the years
on what I would say is the fundamental process technology and the way they can actually concentrate CO2. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as we look at that portfolio
we&#146;ve been advancing there&#146;s more work to be done there for sure. There&#146;s still technology developments that we&#146;ve got to progress. But we&#146;re now seeing I think, you know, with the increased recognition of the need for this
technology, governments being more amenable to an understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re seeing, you know, investor demand where people are interested in investing in those types of projects so I think there&#146;s money
that is looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions and then there is a market growing for reduction credits. We see all lot of things a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole which all contribute to building a
sustainable business. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so we felt like given where things have evolved to now is the time to bring a more concerted effort in this
space and start making sure that we&#146;re staffed and we&#146;ve got people working hard engaging with governments to help move all those things along. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you look at that portfolio project that we&#146;ve got today one of the biggest challenge
is in the policy and regulatory frameworks space and so that&#146;s a real focus area. I think and certainly here in the US, we&#146;ve got an administration that&#146;s interested in progressing in this space and we&#146;re there and ready to talk
with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint. We think the timing&#146;s right. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Jon Rigby: Yes. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: And we think we&#146;ve got&#151;we&#146;ve put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that
forward. But it&#146;ll be I think, you know, this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we&#146;ve got to bring together and we need to make sure that we&#146;ve got our senior management focused on bringing those things
together. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On your CAPEX 2021 CAPEX, you&#146;re right, you know, that is a low CAPEX number for us. In fact if you look at the history and
going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged it&#146;s the lowest level of capital spend that we&#146;ve had in any year. And so I think it&#146;s fair to say just using history as a guide that&#146;s probably not a sustainable level of CAPEX.
And it is in response to the environment that we found ourselves in, in the recovery that we&#146;re making coming out of that environment. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I think longer-term going forward which is one of the reasons why our 2022 through 2025 range and guidance is higher, it&#146;s just a
recognition that in a more steady-state environment the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and underpin the capital allocation priorities we have. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Jon Rigby: Yes make sense. Thank you. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: You bet

few paths you could, you know, to sell carbon credits where applicable. But it also integrates with, you know, the rest of the business in an interesting way particularly gas you have potential customer overlap and bundling opportunities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I know it&#146;s early days but can you just talk about that as a &#150; as something that&#146;s kind of leading the way in this
commercialization effort how it overlaps with the existing business? Thanks. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes sure. I think the point
you make Sam is one maybe I was trying to hit on with Jonathan is, you know, this market demand in terms of people looking for cleaner options and offsets and emission reduction steps. And so we think there&#146;s an opportunity there with that with
many of our&#151;the products in our portfolio. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And we see that across frankly all of our sectors the Downstream you mention gas we
certainly see that they&#146;re in gas and we see opportunities from a &#150; in terms of a recycling or an environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well. So I think yes that as I mentioned the momentum that we&#146;re seeing
broadly in the space is opening up market opportunities which we think this business can take get engaged with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. </p>

apply them. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We&#146;ve got, you know, a very good understanding of
subsurface and how that works. We&#146;ve got midstreams and pipelines. We &#150; if you look at the different elements that have to go into successfully building a CCS business it&#146;s very consistent with what we do today and very much in our
wheelhouse. So we see that as an opportunity. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And

you know, the addressable market here, and your slide on carbon capture, you know, as a percentage of the total carbon offset targets around 15%. You know let&#146;s say Exxon in your &#145;19 Sustainability Report, you have about 120&#160;million
tons of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Is the 15% number of that, kind of a reasonable scope, you know, call it like 18&#160;million tons potentially of scalability here? Is that kind of the way you&#146;re thinking about it? </p>

start to kind of track it like we do all the other businesses. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I&#146;d say that&#146;s a question that we&#146;ll answer as we go
forward and look at these opportunities. I mean a big, you know, variable in all this is just, you know, there&#146;s a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so part of it is a function of how that
external market moves, part of it is a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I think it&#146;s a complicated space but it&#146;s one that, you know, very consistent with what we&#146;ve historically done. And so I
feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in this space. And it&#146;s very consistent with our competencies and capabilities. And so this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute. And it helps society
reduce their emissions. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So but I would say stay tuned. There&#146;s a lot of work that has to happen here. And as we develop that
we&#146;ll be sharing with you how we see that potential here and how these opportunities are developing. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sam Margolin: Thank you so much. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Thank you Sam. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stephen Littleton: Operator, I
think we probably have time for one more caller. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operator: Yes, looks like we have time for one more question. Our last
question will be from Devon McDermott with Morgan Stanley. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Devon McDermott: Hey good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Appreciate it. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stephen Littleton: Morning Devon. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Morning Devon.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Devon McDermott: So I wanted to maybe first <font style="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</font> on the line of questioning
here on the low carbon business. And the last two questions have been on the carbon capture side. But you mentioned some other opportunities in hydrogen and biofuels. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I was wondering if you could just elaborate on some of the types of projects and technologies that you&#146;re focused on advancing there.
And then as part of that as we think about this low carbon spending, that you all planned over the next few years, are there pockets of opportunities across these businesses that are starting to compete for capital with the legacy Upstream Chemical,
and Downstream spending that you have in the Capital Program and where are those biggest opportunities or what&#146;s tangible in the near term for scaling capital? </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes. I would say so we&#146;ve got &#150; we&#146;ve had a very active technology portfolio across this whole
space. You may recall in the past I&#146;ve talked about our energy centers we&#146;ve got around the world where we&#146;ve partnered with universities. Very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an
area where we&#146;ve got a number of different technology drives to see if we can&#146;t develop more cost effective biofuels that work at scale. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 42 </p>

</p><hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>
<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more
energy efficient, less emissions associated with them. And so, you know, trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. There&#146;s a lot &#150; I&#146;d say we got a really broad spectrum of opportunities we&#146;ve been working
on. We&#146;ve got relationships with 80 universities where we&#146;re not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as we see those technologies advance and look &#150; and get higher potential, have a higher potential, those things we would look to try
to bring into the portfolio. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So we&#146;ve got &#150; what I&#146;d say we&#146;ve cast a pretty wide net around the technology space
recognizing that it&#146;s requiring some level of evolution if not breakthroughs in technologies for them to be successful. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I
think you can&#146;t really plan for that. We kind of keep a finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to as they look more promising try to bring them into the emerging and in commercial technology space. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so that&#146;s the work that this new group will be focused on. And again, it&#146;s &#150; it will complement what we&#146;re doing in the
carbon capture and storage. And, you know, we&#146;ve got the biofuels work that we&#146;ve been doing. And we&#146;ve got the process technology work that we&#146;ve been doing. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And a lot of those things overlap with one another certainly. And then, of course that then also has hydrogen. And the process technology work
we&#146;re doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I&#146;d say that&#146;s the
space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then with respect to the spend, you know, this is a long-term focus
area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we&#146;ve made with reducing greenhouse gas, because it&#146;s not something new. It&#146;s something we&#146;ve been after year after year after year. And those
opportunities continue to present themselves. </p>

<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and new processes that
we&#146;ve put in place, we&#146;ve got, you know, more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities so that we can make sure they&#146;re getting funded and moving forward. And that&#146;s all built into our plans and it&#146;s built into
our 2025 objective that we&#146;ve laid out. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Devon McDermott: Great. Thank you. Very helpful detail and sounds like a lot
of exciting opportunities. And my <font style="white-space:nowrap">follow-up,</font> hopefully a quicker one here, as you think about just the capital spending range over the next several years of $20 to $25&#160;billion, and contextualize that with
the analysis that you had in the slides on the amount of cash flow contribution in 2025 and some of the new projects coming online, I was wondering if you could just help us, you know, pinpoint what level of spending you think is required in order
to just hold cash flow across the business flat over a multiyear period understanding it&#146;s higher than 2021 spend, somewhere within that $20 to $25 billion? Any way you can fine tune that estimate a little bit in terms of the maintenance CAPEX,
to hold cash flow steady? </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:-4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Yes. Well I think, you know, the way we tend to look at it is how you maximize
the value. And we don&#146;t &#150; you know we don&#146;t have an objective of trying to hold volumes or any other metric. It comes back to if &#150; what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments, what are the returns that we
think we can generate from those investments, what advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio, how robust are they to the price environment. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I would say that &#150; as we look to build up our investment profile its understanding what the value of those investments are. And then
putting those in the context of the constraints that we&#146;re operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Page | 44 </p>

<center><div align="left" style="width:8.5in">
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I would say, you know, with 2020 one of the things given the impacts of coronavirus and
draw on our balance sheet is we really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We still got a really deep portfolio that we&#146;ll continue to advance. As the circumstances allow and as the market allows, then that&#146;s how we&#146;re
going to kind of go forward. And that range that we&#146;ve given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments. </p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Again, I&#146;ll come back to though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that that will be a constraint that
continues to moderate that capital. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as I&#146;ve shown &#150; I showed on the chart, we&#146;ve got lots of flexibility particularly
as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that&#146;s the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in. Make sure we continue to pay, you know, a very strong dividend. And maintain a balance sheet
that&#146;s going to allow us to ride through the cycles. And continue to invest. Those are the three things. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I would just say
there&#146;s no hard formula. It&#146;s responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we&#146;re striking the right balance because each of those plays a really important part in the value proposition for the corporation. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Devon McDermott: Understood. Thanks again for taking my questions. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren Woods: Thanks Devon. Nice talking to you. </p>
