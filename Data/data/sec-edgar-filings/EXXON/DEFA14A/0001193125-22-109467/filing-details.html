www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News &amp; Resources. The forward-looking statements and dates used in this presentation are based on management&#8217;s good faith plans and objectives as of the date of this presentation, unless otherwise
stated. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date and neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or
re-affirmation of these figures as of any future date. Any future update of these figures will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact. This presentation includes a number of third party scenarios such as the IPCC 74 Lower
2&#176;C scenarios, made available through the IPCC SR 1.5 scenario explorer data, and the IEA&#8217;s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. These third party scenarios reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not
ExxonMobil, and their use and inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their likelihood or probability. The analysis done by ExxonMobil on the IPCC Lower 2&#176;C scenarios and the IEA NZE 2050 scenario and the representation thereof
aims to reflect the average or trends across a wide range of pathways. Where data was not or insufficiently available, further analysis was done to enable a more granular view on trends within these scenarios. Forward-looking statements contained in
this presentation regarding the potential for future earnings and cash flows, emission reduction efforts, dividends, and volumes, including statements regarding future cash flow potential and returns under third-party net-zero scenarios, are not
forecasts of actual future results. The statements and analysis in this presentation under third-party net-zero scenarios represent a good faith effort by the Company to address these hypotheticals despite significant unknown variables and, at
times, inconsistent market and government policy signals. Energy demand modeling aims to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario, including any potential net zero scenario, does
not imply ExxonMobil views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high
degree of uncertainty. For example, the IEA describes its NZE scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party
scenarios discussed in this presentation reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use or inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or
probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil&#8217;s separate planning process, but may be secondarily tested for robustness or resiliency against different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the
modeling of a third-party organization within this document does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization. Actions needed to advance the Company&#8217;s 2030 greenhouse
gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company&#8217;s Energy Outlook research and publication, which contains the
Company&#8217;s demand and supply projection based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy
Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the
Outlook, and the Company&#8217;s business plans will be updated accordingly. ExxonMobil reported emissions, including reductions and avoidance performance data, are based on a combination of measured and estimated data. Calculations are based on
industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and IPIECA. The uncertainty associated with the emissions, reductions and avoidance performance data depends on variation in the processes and
operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Changes to the performance data may be reported as updated data and/or emission methodologies become available.
ExxonMobil works with industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and methodologies, including measurements and estimates. 28 EXXONMOBIL</font></p>
