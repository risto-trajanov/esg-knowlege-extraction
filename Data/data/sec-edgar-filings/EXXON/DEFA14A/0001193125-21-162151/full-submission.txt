 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: The company facing increasing activist pressure. Of course, Engine 1, the
activist in question which supports some pension funds, seeking four board seats. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Joining us now is the CNB &#151; in a CNBC exclusive is
Darren Woods, the chairman and C.E.O. of ExxonMobil. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Darren, it&#146;s great to have you back. And I do want to start off on, you know,
what&#146;s less than two weeks away now, that shareholder vote on your board nominees, because this morning we got a report from ISS, the influential proxy advisory firms, and they&#146;re in support of three of four dissidents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me read this to you and get your response, if I can. They say in their conclusion that additional board change is needed to provide
shareholders with sufficient confidence in the sustainability of Exxon&#146;s business, an immediate concern and one that should arguably take precedence in the order of operations over an assessment of the general sustainability of the industry.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Give me your response to what we&#146;ve heard this morning from ISS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Good morning, Dave. It&#146;s good to be with you, and obviously, we disagree with that recommendation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve got a board &#151; we&#146;ve got one of the strongest boards in corporate America, one that we have been refreshing fairly
regularly. Since I came in in 2017, we&#146;ve brought on six new board members. That&#146;s over half the board. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve got board
members that have extensive experience running global, complex businesses, capital intensive businesses, businesses that are grounded in science and technology, a lot of experience in managing companies, large companies, through significant
transitions. We&#146;ve got shareholder perspective, industry perspective, a lot of capital allocation perspective. So we feel very strongly that we have the board in place to help manage this company and not only drive success in today&#146;s
environment but position the company for longer term success as the industry transitions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I think we&#146;re seeing that, actually,
with the results of the first quarter as we managed through the pandemic period and we see the results of the work that we did last year and the work that we&#146;ve been engaged in since 2017 in reshaping the business, investing in high return
projects, driving simplicity in our business, gaining synergies and reducing costs. And all those are coming together today. We&#146;re seeing those in our first quarter results and, quite frankly, feel very good about the future that lies ahead of
us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: Yeah, and we&#146;ve had a bit of that conversation, of course, when you joined (audio distortion) long ago and I want to
talk more about that. But on this specific fight, because that&#146;s kind of what it is, I mean, when they say ExxonMobil to your point &#151; or at least about the experience of the board has for years filled its board with former C.E.O.&#146;s
without any energy experience, which does seem to be at least behind some of this ISS recommendation, how do you respond to that? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR.
WOODS: I think the challenge in this space is understanding the technology that&#146;s going to be required to drive the industry forward and to support society&#146;s ambition to transition the energy system to a less carbon intensive energy
system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So there&#146;s a &#151; I think a lot of work in terms of thinking about the company, the advantages the company has, the
strengths we have, and how we apply those to successfully transition the company as society moves to a lower carbon future. And frankly, the board that we have today has a good understanding of that, understands the complexity associated with moving
a business like ourselves through that transition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as I said, if you look at the plans that we&#146;ve laid out, the technology that
we&#146;ve been investing in to address the sectors in society that are hard to decarbonize, we&#146;ve got a very good plan, a very good technology pipeline to address not only the challenges today but the challenges that we see coming forward in
the future. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: Well, you know, let&#146;s get to that. I mean, you know, the last time you
joined us, of course, we did spend a decent amount of time talking about carbon capture. I had that conversation as well with your board member Jeffrey Ubben, not long ago as well. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But you know, specific, Darren, to some of the criticisms still, for example, Engine 1 says even by your own limited standards you&#146;ve
actually gone backwards when it comes to upstream emission intensity. They say, &#147;ExxonMobil has gone backwards, aims to do worse in 2025 than 2010. Upstream emission intensity has worsened over the last decade increasing 26&nbsp;percent.&#148;
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Put that in perspective for people so that we can understand at least your perspective on that statistic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Well, we&#146;ve been very supportive of the efforts globally and within the industry to reduce our carbon intensity and carbon
emissions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you look at the progress the company has made since The Paris Agreement has come out, which we supported at the time it
came out and supported it &#151; have been very vocal in our support since then, we reduced emissions through 2020 from 2016 by 11&nbsp;percent. We&#146;ve got plans in place today that drive emissions down even further and, frankly, put us on the
path consistent with the Paris ambitions and the less than 2 degree &deg;C scenario. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I think we&#146;ve done a lot of work to
reduce emissions. More importantly, if you look at what&#146;s going to be required for society to achieve the Paris ambitions, there are a number of the sectors in the economy critical to the economy and critical to people&#146;s lifestyles that
are going to be very hard to decarbonize that today don&#146;t have solutions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have been working for decades on technologies and the
technologies required to address those hard to decarbonize sectors to help society achieve that lower carbon vision, and so I would tell you that that work that we have been doing is starting to pay off. You know that we&#146;ve recently announced a
very large opportunity in Houston that can make a significant contribution to the Biden administration&#146;s recent announcements of reducing &#151; significantly reducing CO2 emissions, make a significant contribution to Houston reaching its net
zero by 2050 emissions target. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And so I would tell you we&#146;ve been doing the work within our own operations to reduce emissions and
doing the work required by society to help them reduce their emissions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. CRAMER: Darren, I actually want to talk about energy for a
second. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Sure, Jim. Good morning. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. CRAMER: Switch things up. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Good morning. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Permian, I
don&#146;t understand it. You got &#151; you have $64 price of oil. I think you guys generally have been cutting back on your drilling plans. To me I&#146;ve got a feeling you could make a fortune here, Darren, at 6 buck &#151; 60 bucks. Come on.
Let&#146;s bring it on. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: We&#146;ve made very good progress in what we&#146;ve been doing in the Permian, and actually, we are
at a fairly steady state with what we&#146;re doing in the Permian. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Last year, as you know, Jim, with the pandemic, the drop in prices
and revenue, we had to pull back across the board on a number of our investments. But we maintained a level of spend and investment within the Permian to make sure that we were continuing to progress the technology advances that we feel like we can
achieve in that to lower the cost, become more productive. We&#146;re seeing the results of that. In fact, I shared that in our first quarter call. Great success at improving the Permian production and we&#146;re &#151; our plans today grow our
production in the Permian. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You know that one of our priorities is rebuilding the balance sheet, which we leaned on
pretty heavily last year. And so right now we&#146;ve got a good pace of production in the Permian, making good progress on that operation. And as we continue down that path and generate more cash, like we did in the first quarter, we&#146;ll use it
to pay down the debt, make sure the company&#146;s in a very good position to face whatever the future holds and whatever the commodity cycle does to us. </P>

hear, or certainly those who may not be ExxonMobil shareholders as yet, and the criticism that you&#146;ve received from these &#151; from Engine 1. Again, I&#146;d love you to respond. </P>

Scope 3 emissions are incredibly costly and prone to failure and heavily dependent upon government subsidies and, therefore, unlikely to enable you to avoid transforming your business model &#151; even the most advanced carbon capture unlikely to
enable you to avoid transforming your business model over the long term, again, your response. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(Technical difficulties.) </P>

Welcome back to Squawk on the Street. We&#146;ve reestablished contact with Darren Woods although via telephone. Darren, we look forward to the day when you will join us in person. We won&#146;t have to deal with any potential issues. But certainly
&#150; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: I look forward to it &#151; I will look forward to that as well, David. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: Yeah, certainly wanted to finish up. So I had asked, of course, again about this criticism in terms of carbon capture and your real
efforts there and, you know, basically whether or not even what they &#151; what your critics would say, even the most advanced carbon capture highly unlikely to enable you to avoid transforming your business model over the long term. How do you
respond? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Yeah, I would say, David, you know, that&#146;s one of the unfortunate things with our discussions with Engine 1 and
their refusal to sign an NDA and allow us to spend some time taking them through our plans, our strategies and some of the technologies that we&#146;re working on. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Frankly, any credible independent body will tell you that carbon capture and storage is a critical element for the world to achieve the Paris
ambitions. The IEA, the U.N.&#146;s IPCC, the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change, all recognize the importance of carbon capture and what that&#146;s going to play with respect to reducing emissions in society. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a company we have decades of experience operating and investing in carbon capture. We know that technology very well. We launched a venture
three years ago to look at, one, commercializing new carbon capture technologies that we&#146;re developing but, two, to look for opportunities around the world where we can use existing technology to reduce carbon capture and storage. And
that&#146;s behind the proposal that we have begun discussing with the administration in Houston. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I would tell you the cost of that
project reduces significant amounts of CO2, on the order of a hundred million tons per annum, by 2040 &#151; we can protect jobs in industries that are currently making products and helping support people&#146;s livelihoods in modern life and we can
create new jobs, build infrastructure and do that at a cost that&#146;s anywhere from a half to a quarter of what the government is currently spending on carbon reduction. </P>

that we have a lot of experience in. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: Yeah, and it&#146;s conversation we&#146;re going to continue to have. In the short time
I have left, you&#146;re saying, basically, Engine 1, you would have them come in and they weren&#146;t willing to do so in terms of signing nondisclosure agreements? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Absolutely. We offered them the same opportunity that we offered D.E. Shaw. And you see the outcome of that. D.E. Shaw &#150; </P>

&#151; came in and we spent time talking to them about the plan. I think they&#146;re very supportive of the direction and the basis on which the board and management have developed those plans going forward. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Offered the same opportunity with Engine No.&nbsp;1. They were not interested in engaging. They were instead focused on us exiting the
business that we&#146;re currently in, undermining the plans that we have and the strength of those plans and, frankly, putting the company&#146;s future and the dividend in jeopardy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: And finally, Darren, because we have you and, of course, it&#146;s been the big story this week, real quickly, but give me your
take on the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, how you think about it and, you know, whether or not it concerns you in some way for the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. WOODS: Well, you know, cyber security as a topic in itself is a real important one and one that the industry is very focused on and as a
company we&#146;ve been very focused on. Frankly, it requires the right kind of architecture and architecture configuration. It requires the right kind of software systems, the right protocol to manage that architecture and the software and,
obviously, the people and the right behavior around the people using those systems. And so it&#146;s a constant challenge, one that we have worked as a company fairly aggressively and it&#146;s &#151; and continue to evolve the work that we&#146;re
doing there. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I would tell you I think the industry as a whole is very focused on this topic and recognizes the threat that it represents.
And frankly, the industry association, the American Petroleum Institute, has a standard that we&#146;ve put in place to try to help companies in the industry manage cyber security. They&#146;re actually in the process of updating that standard, and
I think we&#146;ll learn more from this as the particulars of this incident come out and improve those standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MR. FABER: Darren,
always appreciate it. Sorry for the technological glitch there, but happy we could conclude the interview and look forward to seeing you again soon. Thank you. </P>
