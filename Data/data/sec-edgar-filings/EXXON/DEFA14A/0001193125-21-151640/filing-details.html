outperformance&#151;Will destroy shareholder value &#149; ExxonMobil&#146;s current Board is responsive to shareholder feedback; took decisive action to reorient the Company&#146;s strategy starting in 2017; added members who will enhance
shareholder value; and has a plan to maximize that value through the transition Engine No.&#160;1 ignores or misrepresents third-party data, conflates data from multiple sources, ignores market conditions, and uses <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">out-of-date</font></font> data, all of which lead to misleading conclusions regarding: &#149; ExxonMobil&#146;s plan to maximize shareholder value in the energy transition (pages

carbon tax (slide 38) While we agree regional changes in demand can occur quickly, global changes in demand have taken much longer Engine No. 1 plots the decline in U.S. coal production driven by shale natural gas compared with the U.S. Energy
Information Administration (EIA)&#146;s changing forecasts over time ExxonMobil&#146;s projections for over a decade have included lower U.S. coal use than even the EIA&#146;s most recent forecast U.S. represents &lt;10% of global coal demand in
2019, and coal use is still growing in developing nations indicating the regional differences in energy use ExxonMobil uses a meaningful cost of carbon in its global demand projections, an approach similar to other energy modelers such as the IEA
Engine No. 1 erroneously concludes that renewables plus battery storage is cheaper than gas plus a carbon tax Engine No. 1 assumes 4-hr &#147;storage adder&#148; battery costs; this is well below what would be needed for 24/7 electricity Engine No.
1 implies that ExxonMobil is projecting the mix of renewables in electricity generation will decline (slide 79) ExxonMobil expects renewables and other zero-carbon sources to increase substantively Engine No. 1 erroneously mixes datasets to misstate
ExxonMobil&#146;s position Using consistent datasets, ExxonMobil&#146;s 2019 Outlook for Energy estimates renewables as a % of total generation is expected to grow from 27% in 2019 to 36% in 2040 When nuclear is included, the second largest source
of zero-carbon electricity today, the percentage grows from 37% in 2019 to 48% in 2040 </font></p>

electric vehicle sales are substantially higher than Engine No. 1&#146;s projections. By 2030, ExxonMobil includes 23 million new electric vehicle sales in its 2019 Outlook for Energy. This is 50% higher than Engine No. 1&#146;s white paper, which
assumes 15 million new electric vehicle sales. By 2040, ExxonMobil includes 48 million new electric vehicle sales in its 2019 Outlook for Energy. This is 15% higher than Engine No. 1&#146;s white paper, which assumes 42 million new electric vehicle

Forward-looking statements contained in this presentation regarding the potential for future earnings, cash flow, margins, ROCE, returns, addressable markets, available cash from operations, and operating cash flow are not forecasts of actual future
results. These figures are provided to help quantify the potential future results and goals of currently-contemplated management plans and objectives including new project investments, plans to replace natural decline in Upstream production with <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</font> volumes, plans to increase sales in our Downstream and Chemical segments and to shift our Downstream product mix toward higher-value products, continued highgrading of ExxonMobil&#146;s portfolio through
our ongoing asset management program, both announced and continuous initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, capital expenditures and cash management, and other efforts within management&#146;s control to impact future results as
discussed in this presentation. These figures are intended to quantify for illustrative purposes management&#146;s view of the potentials for these efforts over the time periods shown, calculated on a basis consistent with our internal modelling
assumptions for factors such as working capital, as well as factors management does not control, such as interest, differentials, and exchange rates. For all price point comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, we assume $50/bbl Brent crude prices.
Unless otherwise specified, crude prices are Brent prices. Except where noted, natural gas prices used are consistent with management&#146;s internal price assumptions for the relevant natural gas markets relative to the crude price for a given
case. All crude and natural gas prices for future years are adjusted for inflation from 2021. Downstream and Chemical margins reflect annual historical averages for the <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-year</font> period from 2010&#151;2019
unless otherwise stated. These prices are not intended to reflect management&#146;s forecasts for future prices or the prices we use for internal planning purposes. We have assumed that other factors such as laws and regulations, including tax and
environmental laws, and fiscal regimes remain consistent with current conditions for the relevant periods. This presentation does not attempt to model potential <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> outbreaks or recoveries beyond
historical pricing. Unless otherwise indicated, asset sales and proceeds are consistent with our internal planning. For future periods, we have assumed Corporate&#160;&amp; Financing expenses between $2.1 and $2.7&#160;billion annually. To
illustrate future financial capacity, we have used scenarios of Corporate&#160;&amp; Financing expenses that reflect the estimated potential debt levels under those scenarios. ExxonMobil-operated emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data
are based on a combination of measured and estimated emissions data using reasonable efforts and collection methods. Calculations are based on industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and
IPIECA. There is uncertainty associated with the emissions, reductions, and avoidance performance data due to variation in the processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, quality of those data and methodology used for measurement
and estimation. Performance data may include rounding. Changes to the performance data may be reported as part of the company&#146;s annual publications as new or updated data and/or emission methodologies become available. Emissions, reductions,
and avoidance estimates from <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-ExxonMobil</font> operated facilities are also included in the equity data and similarly may be updated as part of the company&#146;s annual publications. ExxonMobil works with
industry, including API and IPIECA, to improve emission factors and methodologies. See the Cautionary Statement at the front of this presentation for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. 24 </font></p>

historical periods, reconciliation information is provided in the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investor page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News&#160;&amp; Resources for certain terms used in this presentation
including available cash from operations, and operating cash flow. For future periods, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-GAAP</font> or other measures to the most comparable GAAP
financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are outside management&#146;s control as described above. Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a
meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort.
Forward-looking <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-GAAP</font> measures are estimated in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted above. DEFINITIONS AND <font style="white-space:nowrap">NON-GAAP</font> FINANCIAL
MEASURE RECONCILIATIONS. Available cash from operations. Available cash from operations provides an indication of cash flow available to fund shareholder distributions, capex, and debt reduction and is calculated as the sum of (1)&#160;net cash
provided by operating activities from the Consolidated statement of cash flows and (2)&#160;net cash used in investing activities from the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (3)&#160;capital and exploration expenditures. It includes estimated
proceeds from asset sales net of forgone cash flows from divested assets. This measure is useful when evaluating total sources of cash available, including from equity companies, for uses such as capital and exploration expenditures and financing
activities, including debt reduction and shareholder distributions. Lower 2&#176;C scenarios. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on &#147;Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C&#148; and identified 74 scenarios as
&#147;Lower 2&#186;C,&#148; which are pathways limiting peak warming to below 2&#186;C during the entire 21st century with greater than 66&#160;percent likelihood. Operating cash flow. Operating Cash Flow is earnings plus depreciation and depletion,
including <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-controlling</font> interests and abandonment spend, plus asset sales proceeds. Where applicable, <font style="white-space:nowrap">pro-rata</font> equity company earnings are net of depreciation and
depletion. This measure is useful when approximating contributions to cash available for investment and financing activities excluding working capital impacts, applied to the Upstream business. Peers / Peer average. Proxy industry peers are Chevron
(NYSE: CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: RDSA), Total (EPA: FP), BP (LON: RDSA) Project. The term &#147;project&#148; as used in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any
government payment transparency reports. Resources, resource base, and recoverable resources. Along with similar terms, these refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable.
ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as, quantities that are not yet classified as
proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term &#147;resource base&#148; or similar terms is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as &#147;probable&#148; or &#147;possible&#148; reserves. The term <font style="white-space:nowrap">&#147;in-place&#148;</font> refers to those quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be contained in known accumulations and includes recoverable and unrecoverable amounts. 25 </font></p>

RECONCILIATIONS, CONTINUED Return on average capital employed (ROCE). ROCE is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed
(average of beginning and <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">end-of-year</font></font> amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil&#146;s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our
capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation&#146;s total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil, excluding the <font style="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</font> cost of financing, divided by total corporate
average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate
management&#146;s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which are more cash-flow based, are used to make investment decisions. For information concerning the
calculation and reconciliation of ROCE see the Frequently Used Terms available on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com under the heading News&#160;&amp; Resources. Returns, rate of return, IRR. Unless referring specifically to
external data, references to returns, rate of return, IRR, and similar terms mean future discounted cash flow returns on future capital investments based on current company estimates. Investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition
costs. Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). STEPS is an IEA scenario in their World Energy Outlook 2020 based on today&#146;s policy settings and an assumption that the <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> pandemic is brought under control
in 2021. Total Addressable Market (TAM). Refers to the size of the total market revenue of a particular product or service Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time,
assuming dividend reinvestment. TSR is subject to many different variables, including factors beyond the control of management. 26 </font></p>
