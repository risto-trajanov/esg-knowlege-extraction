<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. At each annual meeting of Stockholders, the successors to the class
of directors whose term expires at such meeting will be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. At the Meeting, you will be asked to elect two
Class&#160;III directors to serve until the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or disqualification. In addition, the Board has
adopted policies which provide that (a)&#160;no director shall hold office for more than 15 years and (b)&#160;a director shall retire as of December 31st of the calendar year in which he or she reaches his or her 74th birthday, unless a waiver of
such requirement has been adopted by a majority of the other directors. These policies may be changed by the directors without a stockholder vote. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Information concerning the nominees and other relevant factors is provided below. Using the enclosed proxy card or voting by the Internet or
by telephone, a Stockholder may vote his or her shares for or against, or abstain from voting with respect to, the election of either nominee. If the enclosed proxy card is properly executed and received prior to the Meeting (and has not been
revoked) but no instructions are marked, the proxies will vote &#147;FOR&#148; the nominees. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of Mr.&#160;Ross&#160;J. Kari and

a director, the persons named as proxies intend to exercise their voting power in favor of such person as is nominated by the Board as a substitute. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of five members, four of whom are
Independent Directors. The Board elects the Company&#146;s officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly valuation of the Company&#146;s assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of
the Company&#146;s financing arrangements and oversight of its investment activities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board&#146;s role in the management of the
Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company&#146;s investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GSAM as part of its
<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</font></font> management of the Company&#146;s investment activities. The Board reviews risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the
year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GSAM as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board&#146;s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks
associated with the Company&#146;s investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. Stockholders should note, however, that the Board&#146;s oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure
that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company&#146;s investments. The Board also has primary responsibility for the valuation of the Company&#146;s assets. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has established an Audit Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee and Contract

Director, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Stockholders for Mr.&#160;Ardila to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company&#146;s portfolio companies, his broad corporate
background and experience with financial and investment matters and his significant senior management experience, as described above. Mr.&#160;Ardila generally acts as a liaison between management, officers and attorneys between meetings of the
Board and presides over all executive sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors
and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management and the
Board. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board had six formal meetings in 2019. Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the respective
committees on which he or she served during the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2019. To promote effectiveness of the Board, under normal circumstances directors are strongly encouraged to attend regularly scheduled Board meetings in person.
