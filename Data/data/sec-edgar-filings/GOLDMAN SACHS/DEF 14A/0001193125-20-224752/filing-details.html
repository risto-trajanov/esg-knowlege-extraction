Special Meeting. Such meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof is referred to as the &#147;Meeting.&#148; This Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting, and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to Shareholders

(Eastern time). You will be able to attend the Meeting online, submit your questions during the Meeting and vote your shares electronically. To participate in the Meeting, Shareholders must register in advance by visiting
<b>https://viewproxy.com/GoldmanSachsCommodityStrategyFund/broadridgevsm/</b> and submitting the required information to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (&#147;Broadridge&#148;), the Fund&#146;s proxy tabulator. </p>

number found on the Shareholder&#146;s proxy card in order to register to participate in and vote at the Meeting. Shareholders whose shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee must first obtain a &#147;legal proxy&#148; from the applicable
nominee/record holder, who will then provide the Shareholder with a newly-issued control number. We note that obtaining a legal proxy may take several days. Requests for registration should be received no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on
November&#160;12, 2020, but in any event must be received by the scheduled time for commencement of the Meeting. Once Shareholders have obtained a new control number, they must visit

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>TO APPROVE A <font style="white-space:nowrap">SUB-ADVISORY</font> AGREEMENT FOR THE FUND BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT, L.P. AND
CORECOMMODITY MANAGEMENT, LLC </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Introduction: </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Strategy Fund (the &#147;Commodity Strategy Fund&#148; or &#147;Fund&#148;) are being asked to
approve an investment <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement (the <font style="white-space:nowrap">&#147;Sub-Advisory</font> Agreement&#148;) between Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (the &#147;Investment Adviser&#148; or
&#147;GSAM&#148;) and CoreCommodity Management, LLC (&#147;CoreCommodity&#148;) with respect to the Fund. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Commodity Strategy Fund
seeks to maintain substantial economic exposure to the performance of the commodities markets. In pursuing its objective, the Fund attempts to provide long and/or short exposure to the returns of real assets that trade in the commodity markets
without direct investment in physical commodities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed further below, CoreCommodity is an independent commodity asset management
firm that provides advisory and fiduciary commodity management services to investors globally, with approximately $3.2&#160;billion in assets across long-only and absolute return commodity investment programs as of June&#160;30, 2020.
CoreCommodity&#146;s strategy seeks to provide diversified and unlevered global commodity exposure through a diversified portfolio of commodity futures-related investments. GSAM believes that CoreCommodity&#146;s experience investing in the
commodities markets and long-term track record of performance present a positive opportunity for the Fund. Given the Fund&#146;s investment focus of maintaining substantial economic exposure to the performance of the commodities markets, GSAM
believes hiring an investment manager that specializes in investing in the commodities market, subject to GSAM&#146;s oversight, would be beneficial to Shareholders. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If approved, the Fund&#146;s benchmark would change from the S&amp;P GSCI Total Return Index to the Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index
(&#147;BCOM&#148;), which is more widely used as a commodity benchmark. The majority of the funds in the Commodities Broad Basket and Commodities Focused Morningstar categories use BCOM as their benchmark (77% of funds and 81% of assets). The key
differences in the benchmarks are the weights to Energy and Precious Metals. Although CoreCommodity has a different investment philosophy and employs different investment techniques, it is not anticipated that the proposed <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement with CoreCommodity<b><i> </i></b>will result in any material changes to the principal investment strategies of the Fund. For example, CoreCommodity will take various factors into account when
seeking commodity market exposure, such as, without limitation, the results of proprietary models developed by CoreCommodity, relative price differentials for various commodity futures for current delivery as compared to those for future delivery,
and market conditions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If approved by Shareholders at the Meeting, the <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Advisory</font> Agreement
will take effect on or around November&#160;30, 2020. <b><i>Approval of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Advisory</font> Agreement is not expected to result in any increase in investment advisory fees or overall operating expenses with
respect to the Commodity Strategy Fund.</i></b> </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Investment Company Act of 1940 Act (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;) generally requires
that any investment management agreement, including any <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement, be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Accordingly, Shareholders of the Fund
are being asked to approve the proposed <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Advisory</font> Agreement. The proposed <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Advisory</font> Agreement, a form of which is attached as <u>Exhibit C,</u> was unanimously
approved by the Trustees present at a meeting held on July&#160;23, 2020. Although one Trustee was unable to attend this meeting, that Trustee supported the Proposal. </p>

approval of the Board of Trustees and without obtaining Shareholder approval (the &#147;Manager of Managers Structure&#148;). Under the Manager of Managers Structure, GSAM would have the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board of
Trustees, to oversee any <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers</font> and recommend their hiring, termination and replacement. From the perspective of Shareholders, the role of a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> would be
substantially equivalent to the role of individual portfolio managers employed by GSAM. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At a meeting held on July&#160;23, 2020, the

approved the use of the Manager of Managers Structure for the Fund. Although one Trustee was unable to attend this meeting, that Trustee supported the Proposal. The Manager of Managers Structure would be subject to Board oversight and conditions
imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) in an exemptive order. These conditions include a requirement that any <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement or material change to such agreement be
approved by the Board, including the Independent Trustees. Information on the exemptive order is described under &#147;The Exemptive Order&#148; below. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the supervision and approval of the Board and approval of the Shareholders of the Fund, GSAM is responsible for managing the assets
of the Fund and is permitted under the terms of the investment advisory contract with the Fund to engage <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers</font> to provide portfolio management services to the Fund. If GSAM delegates <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> duties to a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser,</font> it remains responsible for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser.</font> </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 1940 Act generally requires that a written <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement be approved by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund. The appointment of a new <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> or material modification of an existing <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement also must
also be presented for approval by the Fund&#146;s Shareholders as required by the 1940 Act. GSAM and the Board believe that it is in the best interests of Shareholders to provide GSAM and the Board with increased flexibility to recommend, supervise,
evaluate, and change <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers</font> without incurring the significant delay and expense associated with obtaining prior Shareholder approval. See &#147;Benefits of a &#145;Manager of Managers&#146;

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC issued an exemptive order (the &#147;Order&#148;) on May&#160;30, 2013 permitting GSAM to enter into a new <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement or materially amend an existing <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement, subject to approval by the Board (including a majority of Independent Trustees), without first
obtaining Shareholder approval. The Order provides that GSAM will compensate the <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> out of its own assets. The Manager of Managers Structure has previously been implemented by other funds in the GSAM
family of funds. GSAM and the Fund can operate the Fund as a manager of managers fund in reliance upon the Order only if, among other things, the Shareholders of the Fund have approved the Manager of Managers Structure. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Order, the Fund and GSAM are, and would continue to be, subject to several
conditions imposed by the SEC. For instance, as requested in this Proposal, Shareholder approval is required before GSAM and the Fund may implement the Manager of Managers Structure for the Fund. In addition, the Fund must continue to obtain
Shareholder approval to approve or materially modify a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement with an affiliated <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Adviser</font> (as defined below). Further, under the conditions of the
Order, within ninety (90)&#160;days of a change to a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> arrangement the Fund&#146;s Shareholders must be provided with an information statement that contains information about the <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> and <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement that would be contained in a proxy statement. The Order also provides that a majority of the Fund&#146;s Board of Trustees consist of
Independent Trustees and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees must be at the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees. Any changes to a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement that would result
in an increase in the overall management and advisory fees of the Fund will be required to be approved by the Shareholders of the Fund. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If approved by Shareholders, the Manager of Managers Structure will become effective on the same date as the

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A Manager of Managers Structure may benefit Shareholders in that it will allow GSAM the additional flexibility to implement <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> changes or materially modify <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreements when needed, and to avoid numerous and expensive proxy solicitations. Such an arrangement may also allow the
Fund to operate with greater efficiency by allowing GSAM to employ <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers</font> best suited to the needs of the Fund, without incurring the expense and delays associated with obtaining Shareholder approval. If
the Shareholders approve the Manager of Managers Structure for the Fund, the Fund will continue to obtain Shareholder approval of a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement with a
<font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> considered to be an &#147;affiliated person&#148;, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Fund or GSAM, other than by reason of serving as a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> to the
Fund (&#147;affiliated <font style="white-space:nowrap">Sub-Adviser&#148;).</font> </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, to appoint a
<font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> to the Fund or to materially amend a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement, the Trust must call and hold a Shareholder meeting of the Fund, create and distribute proxy
materials, and solicit proxy votes from the Fund&#146;s Shareholders. In addition, if a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> to the Fund is acquired or there is a change of control of the
<font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> that results in the &#147;assignment&#148; of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement with GSAM, the Trust currently must seek approval of a new <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreement from Shareholders of the Fund, even when there will be no change in the persons managing the Fund. This process is time-consuming and costly, and some of the costs may be borne by the Fund.
Without the delay inherent in holding a Shareholder meeting, GSAM and the Fund would be able to act more quickly to appoint a <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> with less expense when the Board and GSAM believe that the appointment
would benefit the Fund. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If Shareholders of the Fund do not approve the Manager of Managers Structure for the Fund, it will not be
implemented and the Fund will continue to be required to obtain shareholder approval of any changes in the <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-adviser</font> of the Fund or any material changes to
<font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisory</font> agreements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Evaluation by the Board of Trustees: </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining whether or not it was appropriate to approve the proposed Manager of Managers Structure and to recommend approval of such
arrangement to the Shareholders, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, considered certain information and representations provided by GSAM. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After carefully considering the Fund&#146;s contractual arrangement under which the Investment Adviser has been engaged as an investment
adviser, and GSAM&#146;s experience in recommending and monitoring <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers,</font> the Board believes that it is appropriate to allow the recommendation, supervision and evaluation of <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers</font> to be conducted by GSAM. The Board also believes that this approach would be consistent with Shareholders&#146; expectations that GSAM will use its expertise to recommend to the Board qualified

Cumulative voting is not permitted. The Proposals will be voted upon by Shareholders of the
Commodity Strategy Fund. The adoption of each Proposal requires an affirmative vote of the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund that are present at the meeting or represented by proxy, if holders of shares representing
more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (ii)&#160;more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (a &#147;1940 Act Majority&#148;). </p>

thereby will be counted as shares present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be counted as a vote in favor of Proposal 1 or 2. Accordingly, abstentions effectively will be a vote against each
Proposal, for which the required vote is a 1940 Act Majority. Ordinarily, <font style="white-space:nowrap">broker&#160;non-votes,&#160;if</font> any, would be counted as shares present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present, but would not be counted as a vote in favor of any Proposal. However, because each Proposal is considered <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-routine,</font> broker <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-votes</font> are
inapplicable to this solicitation and will have no impact on establishing quorum or the votes cast for or against any Proposal.<b> </b> </p>

present but sufficient votes in favor of a Proposal have not been received, the Meeting may be adjourned to a later date by the chair of the Meeting or by a vote of Shareholders to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to a
Proposal.&#160;In the event of a Shareholder vote on adjournment, any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, and the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote in
favor of any such Proposal in favor of such an adjournment, and will vote those proxies required to be voted against any such Proposal against any such adjournment. The chair of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting whether or not a quorum is
present.&#160;A Shareholder vote may be taken on a Proposal in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes for its approval have been received. Such vote will be considered final regardless of whether the Meeting is adjourned
to permit additional solicitation with respect to any other Proposal. Subject to the foregoing, the Meeting may be adjourned and <font style="white-space:nowrap">re-adjourned</font> without further notice to Shareholders. </p>

without limitation, breadth of and availability of accurate information regarding the market in the investment, price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size and type of the order, difficulty of execution, the timing
of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the reputation, experience, financial condition, execution capability, past execution history and operational facilities of the brokerage firm, the extent to which the brokerage firm
makes a market in the investments involved or has access to such market, the liquidity of the market for the investments, the quality and usefulness of investment ideas presented by the brokerage firm, the brokerage firm&#146;s expertise in the
