<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of seven members, six of whom are
Independent Directors. The Board elects the Company&#146;s officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly valuation of the Company&#146;s assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of
the Company&#146;s financing arrangements and oversight of its investment activities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&#160;</p> <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13 </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board&#146;s role in the management of the Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the
Company&#146;s investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GSAM as part of its <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</font></font> management of the Company&#146;s
investment activities. The Board reviews risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GSAM as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk
management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board&#146;s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with the Company&#146;s investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly
addressed. Stockholders should note, however, that the Board&#146;s oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company&#146;s investments. The Board also oversees the
quarterly valuation of the Company&#146;s assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has established an Audit Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee,
Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee and Contract Review Committee. The scope of each committee&#146;s responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Jaime Ardila, an Independent Director, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the
Stockholders for Mr.&#160;Ardila to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company&#146;s portfolio companies, his broad corporate background and experience with financial and investment matters and his significant senior management
experience, as described above. Mr.&#160;Ardila generally acts as a liaison between management, officers and attorneys between meetings of the Board and presides over all executive sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board
believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size
creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management and the Board. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board had five formal meetings in 2021. Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the respective committees
on which he or she served during the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2021. To promote effectiveness of the Board, under normal circumstances directors are strongly encouraged to attend regularly scheduled Board meetings in person. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">None of the Company&#146;s directors attended the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. </p>

Ms.&#160;McGee, each of whom is an Independent Director. Mr.&#160;Ardila simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, and the Board has determined that his simultaneous service on the audit committees of other
public companies does not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Audit Committee. Mr.&#160;Mark serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee have determined that Mr.&#160;Mark is an &#147;audit committee
financial expert,&#148; as defined in Item 407 of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Regulation&#160;S-K.</font> </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee is
responsible for overseeing matters relating to the appointment and activities of the Company&#146;s auditors, audit plans and procedures, various accounting and financial reporting issues and changes in accounting policies, and reviewing the results
and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent public accountants. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current
market values are not readily available. The Audit Committee&#146;s charter is available on the Company&#146;s website (<i><u>https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com</u></i>). </p>

Director, developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and management. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All candidates nominated for an Independent Director position must meet applicable independence requirements and have the capacity to address
financial and legal issues and exercise reasonable business judgment. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers a variety of criteria in evaluating candidates (including candidates nominated by a Stockholder), including (1)&#160;experience

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Governance and Nominating Committee considers nominees properly recommended by a Stockholder. The Company&#146;s bylaws provide that for
any nomination to be properly brought by a Stockholder for a meeting, such Stockholder must comply with advance notice requirements and provide the Company with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a Stockholder&#146;s notice must be
received at the Company&#146;s principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of Stockholders. The Company&#146;s bylaws further provide that
nominations of persons for election to the Board at a special meeting may be made only by or at the direction of the Board and, provided that the Board has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a Stockholder who is entitled to
vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee&#146;s charter is available on the Company&#146;s website (<i><u>https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com</u></i>). </p>

audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2021 (the &#147;Audited Financial Statements&#148;). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit
Committee has: (a)&#160;reviewed and discussed the Audited Financial Statements with the management of the Company; (b)&#160;discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301 (Communications with
Audit Committees), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;); and (c)&#160;received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Ethics and
Independence Rule 3526 regarding the independent auditor&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor the auditor&#146;s independence. </p>

accounting and are not employed by the Company for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by
management or the Company&#146;s independent auditor. Accordingly, the Audit Committee&#146;s oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles
and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee&#146;s considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide
assurance that the audit of the Company&#146;s financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on its consideration of the Audited Financial Statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the Company&#146;s
independent auditor, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Audited Financial
Statements be accepted by the Board of Directors and included in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-K</font> for the last fiscal year for filing with the SEC. </p>
