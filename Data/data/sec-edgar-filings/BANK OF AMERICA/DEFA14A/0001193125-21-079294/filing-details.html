leadership. Our Board and management-level Global Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Committee are actively engaged in the oversight of our ESG programs and strengthening our ESG practices to support Responsible Growth. Our ESG approach is
integrated into each of our eight lines of business and helps define how we pursue growing business opportunities and manage risk. Our commitment to drive racial equality and economic opportunity. Integral to sustainable Responsible Growth is
sharing our success with the communities in which we operate, which we do through our industry leading ESG initiatives, including taking action to drive progress on racial and economic inequality in the United States. Our company believes that we
have a role to play in helping communities move forward. This understanding is core to our company&#8217;s commitment to Responsible Growth and to the people and communities we serve. As part of that commitment, our company knows that it must take
action to address the real consequences of systemic racism. Being a great place to work. Another way we drive Responsible Growth is by being a great place to work. We deliver on our commitment to be a great place to work by being a diverse and
inclusive workplace, attracting and developing exceptional talent, supporting employees&#8217; physical, emotional, and financial wellness, and recognizing and rewarding performance. Our focus on climate change and the environment. In February 2021,
we outlined initial steps to achieve our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations, financing activities, and supply chain before 2050. We continue to actively engage with our clients to support their own transitions to net
zero and plans to establish interim emissions targets for high-emitting portfolios, including energy and power. In addition, we released our broader 2030 operational and supply chain goals as part of a holistic commitment to environmental
sustainability. We also have named a Global Climate Risk Executive, who reports to our Chief Risk Officer and updates our Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Committee on associated risks. Our decade-long focus on Responsible Growth positioned us to be a
source of stability for our customers and clients during this health and humanitarian crisis, to continue supporting the communities in which we work and live, and to consistently deliver for our shareholders. At Bank of America, we focus on results
and on how we deliver them. One of the things we should all be proud of is how we have delivered for our traditional stakeholders, customers, teammates and shareholders, and how we delivered for the broader society at the same time. A concept we
embrace&#8212;the &#8220;genius of the and&#8221;(1)&#8212;applies to how we are delivering for customers, for teammates, for shareholders, AND for our communities and the society in which we operate. &#8212; Brian Moynihan, CEO and Chairman

of $17.9 billion, or $1.87 per diluted share, down from $27.4 billion and $2.75 per share in 2019, reflecting the impact of higher credit costs as we built reserves for potential future credit losses and lower interest rates Revenue of $85.5 billion

Our
Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that an individual who is 75 generally shall not be nominated for election to the Board. In accordance with these guidelines, Jack Bovender, who is 75, is retiring from the Board at our April 2021, annual
meeting. In consideration of Jack&#8217;s retirement, the Board&#8217;s Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, in consultation with the Board, undertook a deliberative process that began in 2019 to identify a Lead Independent
Director successor and implement an orderly transition. The Committee took into account a number of factors before recommending a successor to the independent directors for their consideration, including key skills, and competencies, professional
and personal attributes needed to be successful in the lead independent director position, and the time necessary to discharge the duties of a lead independent director. In addition, Mr. Bovender and the chair of the Committee, Mr. May, met with
each independent director individually to discuss the key skills and competencies of the Lead Independent Director position, and potential successors to Mr. Bovender. These conversations were reviewed with the Committee and the Board. On September
23, 2020, our independent directors unanimously selected Lionel Nowell to succeed Jack, upon Jack&#8217;s retirement in April 2021. Lionel has worked closely with Jack to facilitate an orderly transition for this important position. See pages 19 and

critical for business, society and the planet, and that companies can report on regardless of industry or region. The metrics strengthen the ability of companies and investors to benchmark progress on sustainability matters, thereby improving

initial steps to achieve our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050. We continue to actively engage with our clients to support their transitions to net zero and plan to
establish interim emissions reduction targets for high-emitting portfolios, including energy and power. In addition, we released our broader 2030 operational and supply chain goals as part of a holistic commitment to environmental sustainability. We
achieved carbon neutrality in our operations in 2019. Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRPF). Details on our approach to addressing climate change and managing risk in our financing activities can be found in our ESRPF. Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). We published our TCFD Report in April 2020. The report highlights how we address and report on climate-related risks over the past two decades and how we evolved our actions over time as our understanding
of the risks has increased. We will continue to evaluate the impact of climate change on our business and financial results, and as we better understand how to measure and model climate-related risks and their potential significance, we will
disclose as appropriate. Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We issued our first SASB Index in July 2020. The report provides a comprehensive view of our progress towards achieving our sustainability goals. We are committed to
improving the environment in how we approach our global business strategy, work with partners, make our operations more sustainable, support our employees, manage risks, and govern our activities. Since 2007, our Environmental Business Initiative
has mobilized more than $200 billion in financing to low-carbon, sustainable business activities across the globe. Our multi-year financing commitment provides financial capital, along with significant intellectual capital, to develop solutions to
climate change and other environmental challenges. We are focused on low-carbon energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, in addition to addressing other important areas like water conservation, land use, and waste. </font></p>
