ask that question. We ask it of our customers and clients, we ask it of our teammates, we ask it of our communities and we ask it of our shareholders. The answers we hear shape all we do as a company. Shareholders tell us they&#146;d like us to keep
delivering responsible growth. Focusing on responsible growth has allowed us to deliver strong success for our customers, clients and employees. This has produced strong financial returns for those who invest in our company and helped drive progress
on societal priorities that impact all those we serve. Fundamental to this is being a great place to work and investing in the people who serve our clients and live and work in local communities across the U.S. and around the world. This is a core
tenet of our framework of responsible growth. As we meet with our shareholders and other stakeholders, the importance they place on transparency and understanding of our employee practices is a common theme. With this report, we are pleased to
provide additional clarity around all we do to support our teammates and their families, as well as some additional steps we are taking to continue to build on this progress. While we are making great strides, we know we have more to do. In sharing
this report with you, we hope it will make it easier for you to see the full context of what we do as we continue to deliver responsible growth and help make financial lives better for all those we serve. Thank you. </font></p>

2019, 88% of teammates (nearly 180,000 people) participated, demonstrating our teammates&#146; willingness to give us feedback on how we are meeting their needs. Since 2012, our Employee Engagement Index has steadily increased to record levels at
85%. We also measure an internal D&amp;I Index1 that gives us feedback on our D&amp;I orts and how our teammates feel about being able to bring their whole selves to work. This index is also at record levels. As further evidence of our inclusive
culture, we also continue to see an increase in teammates who feel free to speak their minds and share opinions.The results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our orts
are reflecting our progress in being a great place to work, and resulting in record engagement levels and historically low turnover across the company.Employee Engagement Survey and turnover results90 16Employee Engagement Score Turnover85 1585%

providing feedback to the company and they&#146;re having that much more influence over the company and culture. This in turn leads to a more involved and focused workforce, which naturally reduces turnover, and ultimately leads to stronger
relationships and greater client satisfaction.&#148; &#150; Dean Athanasia, President CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS1 Our Diversity and Inclusion Index measures core areas like how comfortable teammates feel sharing erent opinions without fear of
negative consequences, whether or not they feel they are being treated fairly, their impression of how well Bank of America has done in creating an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed, and how Bank of America values the
unique experiences our teammates bring to the workplace.18 BANK OF AMERICA </font></p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p> <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">
