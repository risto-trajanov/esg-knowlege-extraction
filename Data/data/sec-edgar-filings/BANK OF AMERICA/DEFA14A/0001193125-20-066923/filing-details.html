before year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate o We publicly disclose our gender and racial pay ratios and have done so for the last 3 years o For 2019, compensation received by female employees
was more than 99% of that received by male employees in comparable positions, and compensation received by employees of color in the U.S. was more than 99% of that received by all other employees in comparable positions. This ratio is our equal pay

among those sharing the relevant gender or racial characteristic but who likely have different jobs, skills, experience, and work locations o As a result, the median pay ratios requested in the proposal provide no meaningful insights as they neither

(continued) &#8226; The information contained on our &#8220;Continued Progress in Driving Financial Performance&#8221; slide is based on data available at the time of our 20194Q earnings presentation. The data speaks only as of the particular date
or dates included in the slide. We do not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any duty to, update any of the information provided. &#8226; In the Consolidated Statement of Income, amounts related to certain asset and liability management
activities have been reclassified from Other income to Market making and similar activities, which was previously referred to as Trading account income. All prior periods presented reflect this change, which has no impact on our Total noninterest
income or Net income, and has no impact on business segment results. The amounts included in Market making and similar activities related to this change in presentation are as follows: $930 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2018, and $53 million, $411 million, $36 million, $430 million and $177 million in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively. &#8226; We may present certain key performance indicators
and ratios, including year-over-year comparisons of revenue, noninterest expense and pretax income, excluding certain items (e.g., DVA) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides
additional clarity in understanding our results of operations and trends. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and
accompanying reconciliations and other earnings-related information available through the our Investor Relations website (information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference). &#8226; We view net interest income and related ratios
and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides investors with a more accurate
picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that the presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. The FTE adjustment was $145MM, $148MM,
$149MM, $153MM and $155MM for 4Q19, 3Q19, 2Q19, 1Q19 and 4Q18, respectively. &#8226; We allocate capital to our business segments using a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based
capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements
are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. 22Appendix A:
