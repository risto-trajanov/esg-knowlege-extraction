income of $32.0 billion, or $3.57 per diluted share, up from $17.9 billion or $1.87 per diluted share in 2020, driven by provision benefit and revenue growth, partially offset by higher expenses Revenue of $89.1 billion was up 4% driven by growth in
noninterest income; primarily in investment and brokerage services and investment banking fees Noninterest expense of $59.7 billion, up 8% from $55.2 billion in 2020 Provision benefit of $4.6 billion, including a reversal of reserves built during
2020, reflecting macroeconomic and credit quality improvement Net charge-offs of $2.2 billion improved 46% from 2020, resulting in a historically low net charge-off ratio of 0.25% of average loans and leases Record liquidity $1.2T and $172B of CET1

average S&amp;P 500 index Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common shareholders' equity.
Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as net income applicable to common shareholders of $30.6B divided by average common shareholders' equity of $249.8B, reduced by goodwill of $69.0B and intangible assets (excluding
mortgage servicing rights) of $2.2B, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $0.9B. Management uses this measure to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity and to support overall growth objectives. Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of
10.6% remains well above our 9.5% regulatory minimum requirement. Represents capital returned via common stock repurchases, net of repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and dividends payments divided by net

verified carbon credits. We recognize air travel generates a significant amount of GHG emissions. To reduce air travel emissions, we recently announced that we will support the financing, production, and use of 1 billion gallons of sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030. We have committed to support these efforts through financing, investment, capital markets and procurement activities. Our commitment includes $2 billion in financing and capital deployment and 20% use of SAF for

with our PCAF and NZBA commitments: We expect to begin to disclose financed emissions no later than 2023 We expect to set 2030 targets for the significant majority of financed emissions in our portfolio by 2024 We plan to establish interim emissions
reduction targets for high-emitting portfolios, and announce our first set of emission reduction targets for energy, power and auto manufacturing in April, 2022 To complement these targets, we are also reviewing opportunities to enhance our policies

these particular actions. On February 22, 2022, following extensive engagement with our shareholders, our Board adopted an amendment to our Bylaws to specify that the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions involving the company shall be
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. The Board is asking our shareholders to ratify its decision to amend the Bylaws to provide for the Delaware Exclusive
Forum Provision. Following extensive review, the Board believes the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision protects shareholders&#8217; rights, is an appropriate risk mitigation measure, is narrowly tailored to apply to only the specified claims, is
consistent with the majority practice of S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500 companies incorporated in Delaware, and is in shareholders&#8217; and the company&#8217;s best interests. Exclusive forum provisions are very prevalent for large U.S. companies:
Among companies incorporated in Delaware, 64% of S&amp;P 500 and 63% of S&amp;P 100 companies have adopted exclusive forum provisions. In the event a majority of shareholder votes cast vote against ratifying the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision,
the Board will amend our Bylaws to remove the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision. For more information about this proposal #4, see pages 85-86 of our 2022 Proxy Statement Our Board requests your support for the following proposal # 4 &#8211; FOR

Forward-Looking Statements This supplemental material contains certain statements regarding Responsible Growth and environmental, social, and governance information and opinions, including metrics, goals, and commitments, and sustainability strategy
(ESG Information). Such statements regarding Responsible Growth and ESG Information are not guarantees or promises that such metrics, goals, or commitments will be met and are based on current goals, commitments, estimates, assumptions, developing
standards, and methodologies, and currently available data, which continue to evolve and develop. Additionally, certain statements contained in this supplemental material may constitute &#8220;forward-looking&#8221; statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements about our future financial performance and business, Responsible Growth and ESG Information, which may evolve over time. We use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221;
&#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts, are not guarantees
of future results or performance, involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond our control and are inherently uncertain. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from
those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the uncertainties and risks discussed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any website references are provided for convenience only, and the content on the referenced websites is not incorporated by
