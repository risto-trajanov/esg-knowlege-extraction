as part of being a great place for us all to work. Helping teammates thrive during a year of change included offering programs to support them and their families through life&#146;s important moments, creating opportunities to help them grow and
develop in their careers and being a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our focus for much of the past two years has been on prioritizing our teammates&#146; health and safety as the health crisis continues to evolve. We relied on strong partnerships
with health experts, local health networks and other resources to inform decisions we made as a company and to provide appropriate guidance and resources to our employees. Additionally, we continued to address racial, social and economic issues
facing our communities, many accelerated by the health crisis, both internally and externally. We created opportunities for employees to connect with and support each other, and advanced our long-term investments through community partnerships and
grants to support education and <font style="white-space:nowrap">job-skill</font> programming as part of our $1.25&#160;billion, five-year commitment to advance racial equality and economic opportunity. We continued to evaluate and expand our
benefits and programs already in place. We have built a strong and diverse talent pipeline through our campus recruiting programs &#151; including one of our most diverse classes ever in 2021&#151; and through community partnerships. These
partnerships are helping our company attract future leaders and advance racial equality and economic opportunity in the communities where we live and work. And we&#146;re seeing the progress from these combined efforts, including increases in our
diverse representation of women and people of color. We will continue to report on these items and the progress we&#146;re making as part of our ongoing commitment to being a great place to work for all teammates. &#147;Achieving Responsible Growth
means we want to attract, develop and retain the best people, and to do that, we work hard to offer an inclusive workplace, career growth and development, and rewarding and comprehensive benefits that will help our employees thrive at every stage of
their careers and their lives &#151; that has never been more important.&#148; Sheri Bronstein Chief Human Resources Officer 1 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021 </font></p>

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">Protecting employees and their families during the global health crisis The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. In
2021, as the world faced a second year with the coronavirus, we helped safeguard and support our employees and their loved ones. Supporting our teammates&#146; health and safety Throughout 2021, we supported our employees as they adapted to the
developing global health crisis. We expanded our health and wellness programs, increased benefits for child and adult care, provided flexible time off and offered free <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> testing as well as vaccine
clinics in some of our workspaces. To help teammates stay healthy, we offered 24/7 access to <font style="white-space:nowrap">no-cost</font> virtual general medicine and behavioral health resources for eligible employees, and invited health experts
to share their latest insights into the evolving situation through video discussions and ongoing guidance and tips for preventing illness. We also offered support and resources to those diagnosed with or recovering from coronavirus, and our Life
Event Services (LES) and Medical Benefits Escalations teams responded to employees facing challenges related to the pandemic. Returning to the office safely We continue to evolve our benefits, programs and support for teammates working in our U.S.
financial centers, call centers and operation centers. This has included special compensation incentives, reimbursement for alternative forms of transportation and other tailored support, such as meals and meal subsidies in select U.S. locations. To
drive vaccine awareness and make it easy for employees choosing to be vaccinated, we offered paid time off to receive the shots. As vaccination rates increased and it was determined safe to do so, we began returning teammates to the office who had
shared they were vaccinated through our secure online tool, with 30 days&#146; advance notice. As employees returned to the office, we put health and safety protocols in place, including conducting enhanced cleanings, offering onsite testing,
providing health supplies (such as face coverings, gloves and hand sanitizer) and following other protocols recommended by health officials. By the end of 2021, more than 100,000 employees were working in the office and nearly all of our offices
were open. In 2022, we continue to monitor and react to the changing environment so we can help our teammates stay healthy and safe as the fight against the coronavirus evolves. We are hosting <font style="white-space:nowrap">on-site</font> <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> vaccination and booster clinics and are reinforcing that receiving a booster is critical to protecting our employees and community. Earlier this year, we committed to donating $100 for each U.S. employee
who registers that they received a booster, and have committed $10.6&#160;million to help fight hunger in our local communities. BANK OF AMERICA 2021 | 2 </font></p>

wellbeing of our employees and their loved ones in 2021, and provided comprehensive benefits and programs to support their overall wellness and help them thrive. Physical wellness In addition to the work we&#146;re doing to support our employees and
their families during the global health crisis, our approach to physical wellness is based on how we can help employees address health risks and manage health care costs, including by providing robust health and insurance benefits as well as
wellness and prevention resources. For the ninth year in a row, we held medical premiums flat for U.S. employees earning less than $50,000 in performance year cash compensation. And, for the fifth straight year, employees earning between $50,000 and
less than $100,000 saw nominal premium increases. We enhanced benefits for employees and their families, including approximately 60,000 free virtual consults with physicians and behavioral health specialists. We introduced a new cancer support
benefit for employees and loved ones to help schedule expedited appointments, coordinate care, recommend a local facility and more. We provided <font style="white-space:nowrap">no-cost</font> virtual medical consultations with Teladoc&#174; and a
24/7 nurse line for those enrolled in our national U.S. bank medical plans. Our popular Get Active! employee fitness challenge helped to encourage teammates to engage in physical activity during the health crisis. Together, our teammates took more
than 5.3&#160;billion steps and learned more about the importance of physical activity, nutrition, stress reduction and sleep. Emotional wellness Mental health has been an increasingly urgent and important focus as the global health crisis
continues, and we&#146;ve provided additional resources to help employees manage stress, build resiliency and pursue mindfulness. We added access to licensed social workers and psychologists for youths aged
<font style="white-space:nowrap">13-17</font> through Teladoc in addition to the <font style="white-space:nowrap">no-cost</font> virtual consultations with mental health specialists for employees in our national medical plans. Over 23,000 telephonic
and <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">face-to-face</font></font> confidential counseling sessions were supported through our Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and we began offering

experts inside and outside the company for assistance with significant events like domestic violence, natural disasters, terminal illness, survivor support and more. We continued to provide additional resources from Thrive Global, including digital
programs and access to our new training resource, Thriving Families modules, to assist with navigating new home and work routines. All employees globally have access at no cost to mindfulness apps, <font style="white-space:nowrap">company-led</font>
mindfulness training and daily mindfulness practices to keep a focus on mental health throughout the year. We provide 26 weeks of parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, 16 weeks of which are fully paid for eligible teammates. Our
Family Planning Reimbursement program provides teammates with the flexibility to choose reimbursement for eligible adoption, fertility and/or surrogacy expenses, up to a collective $20,000 lifetime maximum over the course of their career at the
company, and our Family Support program (through our company&#146;s national health plans) offers additional support for new or future parents. To help employees when child or adult care plans fall through, we increased our <font style="white-space:nowrap">back-up</font> care program to offer 50 days of <font style="white-space:nowrap">back-up</font> care for both adults and children (up from 40 days). Understanding that time off is important for emotional wellness, we added
more flexibility with vacation and paid personal/illness days for U.S. teammates, including: &#149; The option to carry over up to five days of <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">accrued-but-unused</font></font>

of every connection. So, it&#146;s especially important that we support the financial wellness of our employees. That includes offering benefits and programs to help employees reach their short- and long-term financial goals, plan for the future and
manage life&#146;s priorities. In 2021, we introduced several enhancements to our Child Care Plus&#174; reimbursement program to increase the number of teammates eligible for this benefit. We increased the reimbursement to $275 per month, per
eligible child to offer more assistance with childcare costs when employees need to be at work. We offer education benefits to teammates and their children to support their goals, from going back to school or pursuing
<font style="white-space:nowrap">job-related</font> courses, degrees or approved professional certification exams to looking for guidance as their children prepare for college. In 2021, we provided $22&#160;million in tuition assistance&#151;a 40%
increase over 2020&#151;for approximately 5,000 teammates. Employees are eligible to receive up to $7,500 per year to help with academic degrees or certifications. We also offer free,
<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">one-on-one</font></font> expert college admissions coaching for teammates and their children in school grades 8&#150;12 to help plan for and navigate the college admissions and
financial aid process. We automatically enroll teammates into the 401(k) plan to help with saving for retirement. Based on service for eligible U.S. teammates, we make an annual contribution of 2%&#150;3% regardless of employee 401(k) contribution
level. We also offer matching contributions of up to 5% of eligible pay on a <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">dollar-for-dollar</font></font> basis. We offer an Employee Relief Fund, which provides employees up to
$2,500 in relief per event for a qualified disaster and up to $5,000 for an unexpected emergency hardship. Employees can receive up to $10,000 in total grants in a rolling <font style="white-space:nowrap">12-month</font> period. Since the beginning
of the health crisis in 2020, we have provided a total of $13&#160;million to teammates from the fund. We continue to offer benefits and programs to help teammates focus on their financial health: &#149; Experienced independent financial counselors
are available through our Benefits Education&#160;&amp; Planning Center for teammates to receive free, personalized, confidential guidance to help them get the most out of their employee benefits and investment education to help them achieve their
financial goals. &#149; The Financial Wellness Tracker available through Benefits OnLine&#174; helps teammates assess where they are financially and connects them with personalized suggestions and company resources to improve their financial health.
&#149; Better Money Habits is a free education resource helping people improve their financial wellness through our partnership with Khan Academy. Note: Specific programs vary by region. U.S. programs shown. 5 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021 </font></p>

<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">pay-for-performance</font></font> compensation approach strives to recognize and reward performance with competitive and fair pay for the work done, at all levels of our company. We
have long been a leader in establishing a minimum rate of U.S. pay. In May, we built on this history when we announced an increase in our minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 by 2025. We took a step closer to our goal by increasing our
minimum pay to $21 in October 2021, soon after we raised this same wage to $20 per hour in March 2020. In addition, in January 2022, we announced we are once again providing our teammates Sharing Success compensation awards in appreciation for their
extraordinary efforts over the past year. The total value of the awards provided to employees increased to $1&#160;billion this year. This is the fifth time this award has been given since 2017, totaling nearly $3.3&#160;billion. Approximately 97%
of our employees received an award this year. Most awards are in the form of Bank of America stock, providing the opportunity to further share in our company&#146;s long-term success. These awards are in addition to our standard annual compensation
and bonus awards. We also maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews with oversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 15 years, we have conducted rigorous processes and analyses with
outside experts to examine individual employee pay before <font style="white-space:nowrap">year-end</font> compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate. Results of this equal pay for equal work review showed
that compensation received by women was on average more than 99% of that received by men, and that compensation received by people of color in the U.S. was on average more than 99% of that received by
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-people</font> of color employees. </font></p>

</p> <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><font color="#FFFFFF">Employee engagement survey and turnover results We have conducted an annual Employee Engagement Survey for nearly two decades. In 2021,
89% of teammates (nearly 182,000 teammates) participated, demonstrating our employees&#146; willingness to give us feedback on how we are meeting their needs. Since 2012, our Employee Engagement Index score has continued to trend upward, even during
the global health crisis. Through our enterprise engagement survey, we also measure an internal Diversity&#160;&amp; Inclusion Index&#185; that gives us feedback on how we measure inclusion at the bank. Our D&amp;I Index has a positive trend over
time and exceeds industry benchmarks. The results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great place to work. We believe our
employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement results and how our teammates view the Bank as an employer of choice. Over the past decade,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;our turnover rate has decreased and has been among the lowest in
the industry. Following a record low turnover rate of 7% in 2020 reflecting the pandemic environment, like many companies, our turnover did increase in 2021 as labor markets normalized. Even with that increase in 2021, we are seeing employee
