in modern history, our focus on responsible growth has enabled us to be a trusted source of support, strength and expertise for our employees, clients, shareholders and communities. This is possible only because of our more than 200,000 teammates
living and working in the U.S. and around the world. Last year, we introduced our Human Capital Management Report to provide greater clarity and transparency in how we make our company a great place to work and support our teammates and their
families. This report has helped our shareholders and other stakeholders better understand our employee practices. It also serves as a baseline by which we can show the progress we continue to make in supporting our teammates who serve our clients
and communities every day. Since our initial report, we have taken extensive steps to care for the health and safety of our teammates during the current health crisis, including expanding and enhancing employee benefits and resources. We have built
on our efforts to ensure a diverse and inclusive workplace, and have seen increases in diverse representation in nearly every area. And, we continue to make long-term investments in support of racial equality and economic opportunity, including a
$1&#160;billion, <font style="white-space:nowrap">4-year</font> commitment to advance work underway to create opportunities for people and communities of color. With this year&#146;s report, we provide the latest updates in all we do to invest in
our teammates, which will always be core to who we are and how we deliver responsible growth and help make financial lives better for all those we serve. Thank you. </font></p>

produces sustainable results. Each day, our more than 200,000 teammates come together with a shared mission of driving responsible growth. This means: To grow &#151; no excuses. To keep our customer at the center of what we do. To grow while staying
within our risk framework. To grow in a sustainable manner. To be sustainable, our growth has to deliver on three things: 1. We drive operational excellence. This creates efficiencies and savings we invest back into improving our company and client
experience, including investments in our technology, physical network and our people. 2. We share our success with our communities. This includes all we do to drive our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and to achieve progress
on societal priorities, including those broadly defined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: clean/ renewable energy, gender equality, equal access to opportunities for prosperity and others. We do this through our philanthropy,
financing and how we manage our own activities and expenses. 3. We have to be a great place to work for our teammates. Once again, we are publishing this Human Capital Management Report to highlight our work and progress in this area. </font></p>

great place to work for our employees is core to our success, and in our Human Capital Management Report we provide detailed information about how our company supports our teammates and their families. In a year that has brought the biggest health
and humanitarian crisis in our lifetime and a renewed movement for racial equality and economic opportunity, we have taken many broad-ranging steps, including: Supporting employee health and safety, including transitioning 85% of our employees to
work from home; establishing <font style="white-space:nowrap">on-site</font> nurses in a number of offices where teammates are needed <font style="white-space:nowrap">on-location;</font> focusing efforts to care for teammates who self-identify as
being at a high risk for the coronavirus; and providing face coverings and personal protective equipment, conducting enhanced cleanings and installing thousands of wellness barriers Expanding employee benefits, including <font style="white-space:nowrap">no-cost</font> coronavirus testing, <font style="white-space:nowrap">no-cost</font> virtual general medicine and behavioral health consults and mental health resources Launching innovative solutions to support teammates

Expanding our perspectives is a critical aspect of how we drive a culture of inclusion, and open dialogue can help our employees gain a greater understanding and appreciation for one another. Now more than ever, we need to be comfortable with
uncomfortable conversations and deepen our understanding through self-education of people&#146;s differences. This year, we&#146;ve introduced new guides and toolkits, and are able to further drive conversations and help our employees be advocates
and leaders during uncertain times. Through August, more than 165,000 employees have participated in more than 320 conversations in 2020 alone. We also host conversations with external partners and members of the community to discuss topics that are
important to our teammates and clients. This includes a virtual conversation led by our CEO Brian Moynihan, alongside Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie G. Bunch III, UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murgu&#237;a and National Urban
League President and CEO Marc Morial to discuss racial equality and economic opportunity. In addition, our inclusion learning and development programs combine virtual and <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-person</font> discussions to connect

attracting and retaining exceptional talent from around the world. This starts with how we recruit new teammates and extends to the many ways we support their professional development and career growth. Recruiting diverse talent to our company
Starting with early identification programs, we connect first- and second-year college students to opportunities across the company to equip them with the knowledge and skills to meet their full potential. Our campus programs also pair thousands of
interns with leaders across the company to make an impact from the start. Our campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships are fueling a pipeline of diverse talent to our company. We hire from more than 350 universities around the world to fill
internship and full-time positions, including 16 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in key locations, including Puerto Rico, and 17 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Through our Africa Internship Program, we hire interns from
universities in C&#244;te d&#146;Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. We also partner with more than 30 organizations focused on advancing diverse talent &#151; including ALPFA (the Association of
Latino Professionals for America), the National Black MBA Association, HBCU Challenge, Robert Toigo Foundation, Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, The Posse Foundation, Disability:IN and Lesbians Who Tech. In 2020, we launched our first fully
virtual, eight-week summer program for 2,000+ global interns. The program focused on delivering business content, real work assignments and volunteer experiences, while maintaining an interactive, high-touch approach. Additionally, interns were
aligned to one of five learning tracks that offered a broad approach to learning across our businesses. 15 2020 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT REPORT </font></p>

91%. We also measure an internal D&amp;I Index1 that gives us feedback on our D&amp;I efforts and how our teammates feel about being able to bring their whole selves to work. 1 Our Diversity and Inclusion Index measures core areas like how
comfortable teammates feel sharing different opinions without fear of negative consequences, whether or not they feel they are being treated fairly, their impression of how well Bank of America has done in creating an environment where people of
diverse backgrounds can succeed, and how Bank of America values the unique experiences our teammates b ring to the workplace. This index is also at record levels. As further evidence of our inclusive culture, we also continue to see an increase in
teammates who feel free to speak their minds and share opinions. The results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our efforts are reflecting our progress in being a great
place to w ork and resulting in record engagement levels and historically low turnover across the company. Employee Engagement Survey and turnover results 19 </font></p>

contribution by annual pay level, with larger company subsidies for those earning less. Also, our average contribution increases since 2012 have been at or below national health care trends. Teammates are encouraged to complete wellness activities
&#151; and receive a $500 credit to their annual medical plan premium.1 If the employee&#146;s spouse/partner also completes these activities, this credit is increased to $1,000. More than 86% of employees and their spouses/ partners complete the
