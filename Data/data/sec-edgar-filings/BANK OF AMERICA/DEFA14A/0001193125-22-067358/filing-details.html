<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bank of America is a big bank and if you&#146;re doing well for the clients, you&#146;re doing well for an awful lot of people and you&#146;re doing well for
the entire country. It&#146;s all about how can you accomplish the most good. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Michael D. White </b></p>

is driving for Responsible Growth. We know we have to grow and growth is vitally important for any investor. What the shareholders should know is that we as a Board are very actively engaged in overseeing management to make sure that we have a
passion to grow, but at the same time to do it the right way. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The board of directors is the eyes, ears, and voice of the individual shareholder, looking
out for their best interest over the long term. And ensuring that the company is building for the long term. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a world that&#146;s changing so fast,
values are fundamental to culture. Brian goes out of his way to spend time talking about values. It&#146;s all about ensuring that we&#146;re running the bank holistically for the shareholders for the long haul. That you&#146;re building talent and
capability. That you&#146;re being a good corporate citizen in the community. And that we&#146;re incredibly customer-focused. That&#146;s what will make that growth sustainable. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We understand that we need to grow, but we need to do it in a way that&#146;s consistent with the needs of our customers, with our employees, and the
communities that we serve. Bank of America has really led the way in establishing this as a model for driving growth. We have that unique ability to touch the lives of so many millions of people, not just in the U.S., but worldwide. We can be in the
private sector and deliver against social imperatives that the entire world is dealing with. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And what Bank of America has proven is that you can do good
for society and also do good for your shareholders. And those two things coexist in a way that very few companies can deliver against. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It&#146;s about
being the best and about doing it in a way that does demonstrate that kind of Responsible Growth that has, you know, really been the hallmark of the Brian Moynihan era at Bank of America. </p>

Global Head of Private Wealth Management, Deutsche Bank </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You know I&#146;ve been in banking for <font style="white-space:nowrap">thirty-six</font>
years with three institutions: Citibank, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. And frankly, I witnessed over this long career that if you don&#146;t follow a Responsible Growth strategy in banking, sooner or later you will put the institution at risk, put the
reputation at risk. There is no alternative than to be responsible and to have a Responsible Growth strategy. I think the market is recognizing that and our shareholder[s] benefit from that Responsible Growth. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re extremely fortunate to have, you know, a Chairman and CEO who has what I call a very strong ethical compass. The Board recognizes that, and the
Board supports Brian in the strong role he plays to create sustainable growth for the corporation and shareholder value for our shareholders. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Sharon

will have an opportunity to develop a long term relationship that really is productive for them and for us. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It&#146;s important for a board to always
remember that our role is oversight, assuring that we are fulfilling our responsibilities to our shareholders and our other constituents. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A lead
independent director can assure that we are always independent in the board room, that we have a place to go, if we feel it&#146;s necessary, to really provide input to the whole of the governance process. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Responsible Growth is good commitment and a good strategy in good times and bad. I think it&#146;ll carry us through those ups and downs coming through in the
years ahead. </p>

to me is the message we want to deliver to all of our associates, and to our clients. So when you put the customer first, it forces you to think of the long term. Because anybody can make a loan. It&#146;s easy to say &#147;yes.&#148; It&#146;s much
more appropriate that you understand your customer&#146;s needs and the potential solutions that may work in their particular case. Because if we <font style="white-space:nowrap">mis-sell</font> products, we hurt our customer, and we&#146;re not
really going to help them. And long term there&#146;s consequences then both for the customer and for the bank. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you look at our Board of Directors, it
is our role to provide oversight of the way we govern the organization. Our people clearly understand their roles and responsibilities; is there an effective check and balance that we all follow the expectations set out for our role and that
we&#146;re doing it effectively? </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Brian really led the organization into the solution to the problems we were facing in 2008. Building the core values and
the ways we treat each other and the ways we treat clients, because in the long run we all believe it&#146;s going to give us a more vibrant organization, and we can grow with the communities that we&#146;re serving. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve been executing on a strategy that is based upon Responsible Growth, and more importantly a customer focus rather than a product focus. And I think
it&#146;s particularly exciting when Wall Street accepts that maybe this differentiates us from everyone else. And maybe as a result, we&#146;re starting to see, creeping into our stock price, a premium for our focus on Responsible Growth. And
that&#146;s pretty exciting to me. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A good board has a real commitment to the company strategy. We recognize the seriousness of our role. We need to be
independent. We need to understand where they&#146;re going. We have to challenge, but we want to do it in a way that continues to build upon a successful strategy going down the road. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our citizens are worried about the future and what it&#146;s going to look like. We&#146;re worried about our planet. We&#146;re worried about, the way people
are treated. So addressing these things in a systematic fashion and bringing the power of <font style="white-space:nowrap">two-hundred</font> thousand people is a pretty impressive and special thing to see. </p>

Senior Executive VP, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Responsible Growth is the foundation of our strategy. Stakeholders today are
increasingly focused on companies&#146; values, and our employees, teammates, customers, the broader community, they expect us to interact with them responsibly and that has an effect on our brand. So, from a number of perspectives, it&#146;s
absolutely fundamental to our corporate strategy. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board, as a representative of the shareholders, considers the performance of the company in the
context of the strategic plan that management advances. The breadth of experience that the Board has, does bring a helpful perspective. And at times management considers that and changes course. We have a tremendous brand. Brian is a very
hard-working, transparent, knowledgeable individual, and you can just see that emanate right through the whole organization. </p>
