Summary Successful execution of our responsible growth strategy through a less complex, more straightforward business model, underpinned by a sound capital structure and reduced risk, has enabled us to establish and maintain industry-leading
positions across our businesses Commitment to our Board-driven stockholder engagement program and to evaluating and reviewing input from our stockholders as we execute our long-term strategy Our Board is comprised of highly-engaged members whose
expertise and experience are directly relevant to the needs of our business, long-term strategy, and evolving industry Our Board has created a robust process to provide objective, independent Board leadership and oversight and regular Board
refreshment Our disciplined compensation program and performance assessment process aligns pay with performance and encourages long-term focus Our environmental, social, and related governance (ESG) initiatives, including more recent improvements to
our human capital management practices (e.g., increasing minimum wage requirements to $15 an hour for U.S. employees and enhancing parental leave policy), are integrated into our eight lines of business so that we are growing the right way Our Board
recommends voting for all management proposals and against all stockholder proposals 2 </font></p>
