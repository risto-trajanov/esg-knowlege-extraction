challenge to management and among themselves to challenge their ideas, and Jack&#146;s the person who stewards that through. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You can&#146;t just say,
&#147;Here&#146;s our values.&#148; You can&#146;t just say, &#147;Here&#146;s Responsible Growth.&#148; The question is what do you do to live by it. It really means, intellectually, how you get up in the morning, think about what your job is.
You&#146;re coming here to help the customers, and everything behind that. It comes to the way we design the activities we do for the different types of customers. It comes from the business we choose to be in and not be in. And all that is governed
by the view of how we think the company should operate from the Board on down. And we&#146;re good people, and we want good customers, and we want to do the right thing, and we want to help them do it. That&#146;s the moral compass of the company.
</p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Lionel Nowell </b></p> <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Responsible Growth to me means that
we&#146;re conducting business in a way that, uh, positively impacts the communities where Bank of America operates. But at the same time allows us to service our customers and our clients in a way that&#146;s sustainable, but also in a way that
allows our employees, our shareholders, and quite frankly all our stakeholders that we have to, uh, benefit and&#151;and really be proud of the company that they&#146;re associated with. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I mean, the Board&#146;s role...it&#146;s corporate governance. I mean that&#146;s&#151;that&#146;s
paramount to having a&#151;a good company. Our Board is comprised of a vast array of&#151;of diversity. Not just in terms of ethnic, but also in terms of thought. And I think our&#151;our customers and consumers expect that. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Having been at PepsiCo, which is&#151;which is a, like Bank of America, is a global organization, [I] brought a lot of those learnings and how you interact
with consumers and how you do things the right way to Bank of America. And I think that&#146;s been mutually beneficial. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I always tell people, &#147;Man,
you know, with Bank of America, you sure feel like you can live the American dream and we can be a part of that.&#148; </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Denise Ramos </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I started out in oil and gas, a very engineering, industrial kind of a company. I spent twenty years there. I then went to do something very, very different,
and it had to do with understanding what matters to consumers. I recognized it was important to combine those two concepts. It&#146;s not just what you make, it&#146;s how you make it, and how you&#146;re impacting the people. So this concept of
being an industrial company, but with a a human touch with it was really important to me, and that&#146;s really what I advocated in the company. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">My
passion has always been finance. The Bank of America opportunity came up to me, and the key thing that I looked at was &#150; Is this a company I believe in? Is this a company that has a good Board, that I like the CEO, and that I like the culture
in the company? And Bank of America fits that all of that criteria for me. Despite the success that&#146;s here, it&#146;s a very humble culture; it&#146;s people that care about other people, they care about doing the right thing. You don&#146;t
always see that in companies. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It&#146;s really important for Bank of America that we understand that what we do impacts a lot of people&#146;s lives.
It&#146;s not only the bank and the shareholders; it&#146;s the customers, it&#146;s the communities, it&#146;s the employees. It&#146;s very complex, but what underlies all of that is a value structure, making sure that you&#146;re doing it in a
way that can benefit society. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Clayton Rose </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Responsible Growth means that we are focused on the long term and not on the short term, and providing customers with opportunities. It&#146;s not about what
it&#146;s doing for the bank; it&#146;s what it&#146;s doing for and helping our customers. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The larger social issues that exist in our world: Climate
change and economic inequality to name two. I think there are at least two ways that an organization like the Bank of America has an opportunity and I would argue an obligation to be engaged. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first way is to make sure that the financial system and the economic system are furthered by the work that we do, not hindered or harmed by the work that
we do. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But the second is also to bring the resources and the, uh, thoughtfulness of the organization to bear directly on those problems by, uh, providing
funds and encouraging new ways of thinking about solutions to those problems. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One of the things that I think we are, uh, eh uniquely suited among a handful of institutions is because of
the size and scope and scale and integrated nature of what we do within the economy, we have some very interesting perspectives about how to think about those problems, and we&#146;re engaged in helping other organizations think about solutions
because of these perspectives that we bring. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Mike White </b></p>

is that we as a Board are very actively engaged in overseeing management to make sure that we have a passion to grow, but at the same time to do it the right way. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The board of directors is the eyes, ears, and voice of the individual shareholder, looking out for their best interest over the long term. And ensuring that

our corporate strategy. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board, as a representative of the shareholders, considers the performance of the company in the context of the strategic plan

considers that and changes course. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a tremendous brand. Brian is a very hard-working, transparent, knowledgeable, uh, individual, and you can just

constituencies, which includes our associates, both in the short term and the long term. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary function of the Board, uh, is to hold the senior
management and the leadership accountable. And we clearly do that at Bank of America. Uh, it&#146;s to oversee the&#151;the strategy, to make sure we&#146;re, you know, we&#146;re headed in the right direction. And not only for the short term but
