0,"Whereas: Markets require information to operate and deploy capital effectively. In 2019 and 2020, global and U.S. accounting and auditing standard-setters reiterated that material climate-related risks should be accounted for in company financial statements and audits.1,2,3 Major investor groups, representing assets worth over $103 trillion, have also called on companies and auditors to fully reflect climate risks to companies’ financial results and position.4

These concerns reflect a converging consensus by policymakers, investors, and companies on growing climate risk, the need to limit global temperature increase to 1.5° C (net zero global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050),5 and the impact of such actions to companies.

The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero Scenario describes an energy sector pathway to achieve net zero emissions. The Scenario finds that no new investment in fossil supply projects is needed, and anticipates oil prices dropping as low as $36/ barrel in 2030 and $24/ barrel in 2050.6

Given these global climate imperatives, to best allocate investments, investors are calling for information to assess the financial impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks on companies and identify companies best positioned to thrive in a low carbon economy. Yet, more than 70% of listed companies, representing some of the world’s largest carbon-polluters, are not fully accounting for climate-related risks in their financial statements.7

Chevron continues to develop new fossil fuel resources while acknowledging climate related risks8 that could lead to increased future impairments. Despite the materiality of this

issue, Chevron’s audited annual disclosures do not currently provide investors with sufficient insight into assumptions used to assess productive assets for impairment and stranded asset risk. Further, an independent 2021 analysis concluded that Chevron’s financial statements lack the requisite transparency about climate-related assumptions and estimates, and that the company does not appear to use Paris-aligned assumptions and estimates.9

In contrast, peers (Shell, bp, TotalEnergies) have released more transparent disclosures in their audited financial statements, articulating the extent of consideration of climate change contingencies and risks.10

Accurate accounting assists investors in understanding the drivers of risk and return. Investors seek additional information from Chevron to understand the impact of climate-related factors on its business model and current financial reporting.

RESOLVED: Shareholders request Chevron’s Board of Directors provide an audited report addressing how application of the assumptions of the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 pathway would affect the assumptions and estimates underlying its financial statements, including its long-term commodity and carbon prices, remaining asset lives, existing and future asset retirement obligations, capital expenditures, and asset valuations (impairments). The report should be produced at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information."
1,"Your Board appreciates the focus of our investors and stakeholders on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Chevron supports the goals of the Paris Agreement and is committed to lowering our portfolio carbon intensity, on a full-cycle basis, and to being transparent about our progress.

We have substantially addressed the request

Chevron received a similar proposal last year, seeking an audited report on how the energy sector pathway hypothesized in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario (NZE 2050) would affect Chevron’s financial position and underlying assumptions. Subsequent to that proposal, we tested our portfolio using NZE 2050 demand and commodity price projections. We reported on the results of this scenario test in our updated Climate Change Resilience Report in October 2021. That report discusses how our portfolio would fare from a financial viability perspective and also the changes we would need to make under the NZE 2050 assumptions. Chevron’s Corporate Audit department, which performs the internal audit function at Chevron, conducted a non-rated assurance review of the NZE 2050 scenario analysis, and determined that the analysis was conducted in accordance with established internal process and emerging external guidance.

We report in accordance with established standards

We regularly analyze alternative scenarios to stress-test our portfolio, and we integrate those learnings to help us remain competitive and resilient in any environment. This information is confidential and competitively sensitive. We do not report audited outcomes on these scenarios. Rather, we report and disclose in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. With this oversight framework, our strategic plans reflect management’s best assessment of the longer-term outlook on supply, demand and commodity prices and its judgment in deploying the Company’s strategy in that environment. We consider the likelihood of the IEA’s NZE 2050 scenario to be remote and do not rely on the NZE 2050 scenario for our business planning. Your Board believes it would not be a responsible use of Company resources to produce a further report to address a speculative scenario, as the Proposal requests."
2,"Whereas, at least a quarter of today’s global warming is caused by methane emissions from human sources.1 Methane is 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, meaning reducing emissions now can buy valuable time to address the climate crisis.

In 2019, 30% of U.S. methane emissions from human activities came from natural gas and petroleum systems, from venting, flaring, and leaking.2

Methane emissions can be quantified directly through measurement (e.g., by detector, drone or satellite), or indirectly through calculations and modelling. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formula used to estimate methane emissions is not a good foundation for a corporate mitigation strategy, failing to capture many major leaks, wasting valuable product (worth $2 billion per year) and substantially underestimating emissions.3 Studies have found actual emissions to be between 50 and 90% higher than estimated emissions reported using the formula.4 In certain basins, studies have found emissions to be more than 10 times higher than industry disclosed figures.5 As a result, oil and gas industry Scope 1 emissions may be significantly higher than currently reported.

Companies that do not manage methane emissions jeopardize other industry decarbonization efforts, and risk their reputation and license to operate, as investors, regulators and civil society are setting expectations to address this issue.

In 2021, investors managing more than $5.35 trillion supported strong federal methane regulations.6 The U.S. joined the Global Methane Pledge, committing to using best available inventory methodologies to quantify methane emissions.7 Companies, including U.S. companies EQT and Jonah Energy, have joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, committing to improving methane data quality and consistency.8

According to EPA data, Chevron ranks 73d of U.S. top 100 oil and gas producers, with a methane intensity of 0.08%.9 However, given the limitations of EPA’s methodology this ranking lacks credibility.

Resolved, shareholders request that the Board oversee the preparation of a report analyzing a critical climate change concern, the reliability of Chevron’s methane emission disclosures. The report should:

 

•	 	summarize the outcome of any efforts to directly measure methane emissions by the Company;
 

•	 	provide investors with insight as to whether there is likely to be a material difference between direct measurement results and the Company’s published estimates of methane emissions;
 

•	 	assess the degree to which any differences would alter estimates of the Company’s Scope 1 emissions.
The report should be made public, omit proprietary information and be prepared expeditiously at reasonable cost. At management’s discretion, we recommend that the report:

 

•	 	Provide a narrative explanation of the difference between the Company’s estimated methane emissions and the
 	 	
Company’s, own direct measurements, or any third party measurements, by site or region,

 

•	 	Describe any efforts to validate emissions estimates and disclosure through a third-party audit or evaluation."
3,"Your Board agrees that reducing methane emission intensity across all sectors is important to advancing a lower carbon future. Chevron is proud of its progress in managing methane emissions. Although we disagree with some of the statements in the Proposal, we recommend stockholders support the Proposal because we are committed to continuing to advance the accuracy and reliability of methane emission reporting, as further described below.

Current state

Today, methane emissions are generally estimated (which is consistent with EPA protocols) by multiplying an activity or equipment count (e.g., number of pneumatic controllers) by an emissions factor for a particular source or activity (e.g., emissions per controller). These emissions factors are developed based on research, engineering designs, and field studies. We believe the EPA reporting protocol is a sound basis for shaping a corporate reporting program and that it has enabled development of consistent and comparable data, which has helped operators understand methane reduction opportunities. Moreover, Chevron is required to follow the EPA reporting protocol in the United States.

Chevron’s actions to address methane measurement improvement

We are committed to further improving methane detection and direct measurement. We are doing this through our Global Methane Detection Campaign, which focuses on scaling up proven and emerging detection technologies and modes of deployment, such as satellites, aircraft, and drones, with the goal of improving detection of methane emission sources. We also partner with industry, academic and environmental organizations to improve the technology and protocols for direct measurement of methane.

Through these efforts, we have identified encouraging progress in methane detection technology, but also current limitations in quantifying direct measurements of emissions. Direct measurement faces uncertainties and challenges related to modeling wind conditions and plumes, accounting for changing conditions at a site over different time periods, and also challenges with scalability and ability to provide timely data.

Chevron has demonstrated success in reducing methane emissions and deploying technology, and we regularly update stakeholders on our progress through voluntary reporting. Chevron views the assessment of direct methane emissions measurement discussed in the “Resolved” section of the Proposal as largely consistent with our current and ongoing efforts to address Scope 1 emissions. We plan to release a Methane Strategy Update (“Update”) later this year, which will address methane detection, direct measurement quantification, and disclosure. Without disclosing confidential information and to the extent reasonably feasible, subject to the limitations of current direct measurement technology discussed above, we intend to include information referenced in the “Resolved” section of the Proposal in the Update, including how detection technologies have advanced, how they can inform emission reduction strategies, and the challenges and uncertainties of current direct measurement technology."
4,"Stockholder proposal to report on business with conflict-complicit governments

(Item 8 on the proxy card)

 

WHEREAS: Chevron, in partnership with Total, PTT, and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), holds equity in one of the largest investment projects in Myanmar (Burma): the Yadana gas field and pipeline that has generated billions of dollars for the Myanmar military junta. Together, Total and Chevron have a majority controlling interest in Yadana project.

In Myanmar, foreign participation in the energy sector takes place through joint ventures with the MOGE, which is a department of the Myanmar government. Since it seized power in the February 1st, 2021, coup d’etat, the Myanmar military now holds total control over MOGE.

The United States and United Kingdom have imposed sanctions against Myanmar military-owned companies. A bipartisan group of senators have urged the U.S. administration to place sanctions on MOGE.

The Myanmar military has a long history of egregious human rights abuses, particularly against ethnic minorities. In August 2017, a military crackdown caused an estimated more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh where they remain to this day. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has reported that the Rohingya remain “at grave risk of additional mass atrocities and even genocide.”

Nicholas Koumjian, head of the United Nations Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, stated in November 2021, that preliminary evidence collected since the military coup shows a widespread and systematic attack on civilians “amounting to crimes against humanity.”

The National Unity Government of Myanmar, made up of elected officials and civil society leaders, has called on the oil companies operating in Myanmar to withhold from the military junta and place in escrow any payments due to the Myanmar government.

Since the February 2021 military coup, the “Blood Money Campaign” by Myanmar and international civil society organizations has organized protests, consumer boycotts, and media pressure against companies, including Chevron, that provide financial support to the military junta. In addition, dozens of oil workers in Myanmar have petitioned oil companies to suspend payments to the ruling junta.

The International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect (ICRtoP) monitors countries worldwide for instances of serious crimes under international law including genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. ICRtoP lists several countries, cited by the United Nations and civil society organizations, in which Chevron is currently producing oil and gas: Burma (Myanmar), Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria.

BE IT RESOLVED: The shareholders request the Board to publish a report six months following the 2022 annual general meeting, omitting proprietary information, and prepared at reasonable cost, evaluating the feasibility of adopting a policy of not doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide and/or crimes against humanity as defined in international law.

 
 

Supporting statement

 

 

 

As shareholders, we believe that our company has the duty to avoid the moral, legal, financial, reputational, and operational risks posed by doing business with governments complicit in

genocide and/or crimes against humanity. It is incumbent that our board adopts policies that protect shareholder value from these risks."
5,"Chevron and your Board share the proponent’s concern for human rights, and we condemn the violence and human rights abuses occurring in Myanmar. On January 21, 2022, Chevron released a statement announcing our intention to exit Myanmar. We intend to conduct our exit in a planned and orderly manner, and while doing so, we will continue to meet our commitments and support the humanitarian needs of local communities.

Chevron’s commitment to human rights

Our commitment to human rights is reflected throughout our business and in how we conduct ourselves, including in our Human Rights Policy, our Operational Excellence Management System, and our Business Conduct and Ethics Code, all of which are on our website. At times locations where we operate experience civil unrest and challenging conditions. Our approach to human rights is consistent. Wherever we operate, we work to support local communities with basic human needs, including healthcare, education, and energy.

We believe we have the right processes and governance to ensure that we make the right decisions about where and how we conduct our business. Accordingly, your Board does not believe the report requested in the Proposal is necessary."
6,"Stockholder proposal to report on racial equity audit

(Item 9 on the proxy card)

 

Resolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors commission and publicly disclose the findings of an independent racial equity audit, analyzing if, and how, Chevron’s policies and practices discriminate against or disparately impact communities of color. The report should clearly identify, and recommend steps to eliminate, business activities that further systemic racism, environmental injustice, threaten civil rights, or present barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Input from impacted workers, community members, customers, or other relevant stakeholders should inform the audit and report. The report should exclude confidential and proprietary information, as well as information relevant to any pending legal proceeding or threatened proceeding of which Chevron has notice.

Whereas: Racial inequity and environmental racism are systemic risks that threaten society and the economy.1 Companies that fail to correct policies and practices deemed to be racist, discriminatory, or furthering inequities face legal, financial, reputational, and human capital management risks. Companies that commit to holistically advance racial justice and foster DEI benefit from stronger performance, employee satisfaction, innovation, and positive social impact. 2

Chevron is one of the highest greenhouse gas emitting companies in the world.3 Its emissions contribute to the climate crisis, which disparately impacts people of color and furthers systemic racism.4 Chevron’s operations, discharges, and leaks disproportionately burden communities of color with pollution and human health risks.5

For example, 80% of residents living adjacent to Chevron’s Richmond, CA refinery are people of color, and they experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and asthma.6 Chevron’s Richmond facility is the city’s largest polluter and the company has spent millions of dollars to influence city politics and funding.7 Chevron also finances the Richmond police,8 which has been linked to police brutality.9 Beyond Richmond, Chevron finances police groups in major U.S. cities and Chevron representatives serve on the boards of Houston and Salt Lake City police foundations.10. Additionally, Chevron faces scrutiny for financing United States politicians with failing civil rights grades issued by the NAACP.11.

Chevron’s business disparately impacts Indigenous Peoples. Over 60% of publicly reported abuses from Chevron’s operations impacted Indigenous Peoples, including violation of land rights, allegations of genocide, violence against Indigenous women,12 and widespread environmental damage and human rights violations in Ecuador13., Indonesia14., Nigeria15, and the United States16.

While Chevron has made DEI and philanthropic commitments to support Black employees and communities, its practices have historically exacerbated racial inequities.17 An independent 2021 report documented dozens of outstanding legal cases against Chevron for alleged environmental damage and human rights violations, noting that the company has only paid .006% of associated fines, court judgements, and settlements.18 A racial equity audit would help Chevron identify, prioritize, remedy, and avoid adverse impacts on people of color while reducing reputational risk and liabilities."
7,"Your Board shares the proponent’s commitment to addressing racial injustice. Chevron strives to empower people to improve their lives and meet their full potential. This commitment is reflected throughout our business and in how we conduct ourselves around the world. We demonstrate this commitment through promoting diversity and inclusion, fostering prosperity, respecting human rights, and contributing to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals in the communities where we operate around the world.

8,"Stockholder proposal regarding special meetings

(Item 10 on the proxy card)

 

RESOLVED: Shareowners request that the Board of Chevron Corporation take the steps necessary to amend Company bylaws and appropriate governing documents to give holders of 10% of outstanding common stock the power to

call a special shareowners meeting. To the fullest extent permitted, such bylaw shall not contain exceptions or excluding conditions that apply to shareowners but not to the management or Board.

 
 

SUPPORTING STATEMENT

 

 

 

Management’s handling of a range of issues has increased both risk and cost to shareholders, which necessitates lowering the threshold to call a special meeting.

A recent report, Chevron’s Global Destruction,1 documents legal actions filed against Chevron and its subsidiaries around the world – providing evidence that Chevron is liable for $50+ billion in legal judgments and seizure claims globally. This report was the topic of a House Oversight Committee hearing entitled: Fueling the Climate Crisis: Exposing Big Oil’s Disinformation Campaign to Prevent Climate Action.

Perhaps the most pressing issue is the ongoing effort by Ecuadorian communities to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron for devastating oil pollution (the “Ecuadorian Judgment”).

Chevron asserts that “several international courts have determined the Ecuadorian Judgment to be fraudulent.” In reality, no court since the Ecuadorian Judgment was rendered has reviewed the facts of the case de novo. In fact, evidence regarding destruction of the Amazon has been entirely absent from every subsequent case – including Judge Kaplan’s RICO declarations. Neither the arbitration held in the Netherlands under a bilateral investment treaty, nor any court since has ruled on Chevron’s assertion that the Ecuadorian Judgment resulted from fraud.

Therefore, enforcement of the Ecuadorian Judgment remains a serious and ongoing financial risk.

CEO/board chair Michael Wirth’s statements regarding the Ecuador Judgment were challenged in a House Oversight Committee where a Member observed that Wirth told shareholders “[there] was no scientific evidence of contamination.” In subsequent questioning Wirth was asked: “[if there was] no scientific evidence... why did Texaco spend $40 million to...remediate?” He has not yet responded, and has also demurred on the question of how much Chevron has spent on litigation and PR regarding the Ecuador matter.

Alberto Guerra was the principal witness in the Chevron RICO trial. He later recanted essential portions of his testimony and admitted receiving payment from Chevron, and that Chevron’s law firm – Gibson Dunn & Crutcher – had coached him before testifying in 50+ meetings. Mr. Wirth has so far not responded to the House Oversight Committee whether he approved the use of Company funds to pay Guerra – including more than $432,000 in monthly payments and $48,000 in exchange for evidence.

The Ecuadorian Judgment represents a serious liability: under oath, Deputy Controller Rex Mitchell testified that such a seizure: “would cause significant, irreparable damage to Chevron.”

In light of these serious matters – which evidence a lack of accountability in Chevron’s C-suite and board room – shareholders need strengthened capacity to call a special meeting.

THEREFORE: Please vote FOR this sound, Special Meeting proposal."
9,"Chevron has adequate existing special meeting rules

Chevron’s By-Laws permit stockholders owning 15% of Chevron’s outstanding common stock to call for a special meeting. Your Board continues to believe that Chevron’s 15% threshold ensures that a reasonable number of stockholders consider a matter important enough to merit a special meeting. Preparing for and holding a special meeting is time-consuming and expensive. The 15% threshold helps avoid waste of Company and stockholder resources to address narrow or special interests.

In addition to an appropriate ownership threshold, Chevron’s By-Laws include reasonable limitations that the proposal would eliminate. Under the By-Laws, a special meeting cannot be called:

 

 	1.	
If the Board has already called or will call an Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the same purpose specified in the special meeting request, or

 

 	2.	
If an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request for a special meeting was received and included the purpose specified in the special meeting request.

Given the time and cost associated with special meetings, your Board believes that these are appropriate and reasonable limitations.

Stockholders’ rights are protected

Stockholders can be assured that their right to be apprised of and vote on significant matters is protected not only by their existing right to call for special meetings and participate in Chevron’s Annual Meeting, but also by state law and other regulations. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware, which requires that major corporate actions, such as a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of Chevron’s assets, be approved by stockholders. Also, Chevron is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which requires, among other things, that listed companies obtain stockholder approval for equity compensation plans and significant issuances of equity securities to related parties and for when such issuances represent more than 20% of an issuer’s voting power.

Chevron has robust corporate governance practices to protect stockholder interests, including a declassified Board; proxy access; no supermajority voting provisions in its By-Laws and Certificate of Incorporation, and a strong independent Board structure.

Proposal is a vehicle for tired and baseless allegations

Finally, although the proposal purports to relate to special meetings, its supporting statement shows that this is a vehicle to discuss the fraudulent Ecuador litigation and various frivolous allegations against Chevron. The “report” referenced in the supporting statement is riddled with falsehoods–including the allegation that “Chevron is liable for $50+ billion in legal judgments”–which have no basis in fact.

Your Board continues to believe its current By-Law is in stockholders’ best interests and provides appropriate reasonable limitations on the right to call special meetings."
