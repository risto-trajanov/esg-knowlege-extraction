1,"Sustainable finance continues to expand in Latin America, as governments and companies take advantage of growing interest among investors in instruments that protect biodiversity and respond to the climate crisis. In 2020, more than US$16 billion of green, social and sustainable bonds were issued in the region.

Though their purpose may vary, these bonds share similar characteristics. A company or government takes on debt, and these funds must be used exclusively to meet a specific environmental or social goal, such as developing clean transport infrastructure, expanding renewable energy or meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.

$1billion

The upper amount of debt (US$) that Uruguay's sovereign green bond will initially issue, according to the environment ministry

The upper amount of debt (US$) that Uruguay's sovereign green bond will initially issue, according to the environment ministry

However, with the growth of sustainable finance, new and even more innovative types of debt instruments have emerged, such as one now proposed by Uruguay. The government of president Luis Lacalle Pou is working on a bond whose funds will not be designated for a specific purpose, but will instead pay for different initiatives, and at a variable interest rate.

This rate will depend on whether Uruguay meets a previously established environmental target, such as its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. In other words, if the country reduces its emissions as committed, it will be rewarded with a lower rate. And if it does not comply, it will be penalised with a higher rate.

So far, the only country to have developed such an instrument has been Luxembourg, which issued US$1.5 billion in debt in 2020. According to the Uruguay’s environment minister, Adrián Peña, the country’s own the bond will be for an amount between US$800 million and US$1 billion, with no exact date for its issuance yet set.

Developing countries like Uruguay are especially vulnerable to the climate and biodiversity crisis, and need financial support to meet their environmental or climate commitments. This is where sustainable finance comes in, as an instrument to support the transition of their economies.

Sustainable finance in Latin America

Mechanisms for sustainable finance continue to grow more numerous and diverse. Argentina and Colombia, for example, have recently called for an expansion of debt-for-nature swaps, a tool already in use that would allow them to reduce their debts and also meet environmental targets. Elsewhere, finance experts have pushed for the creation of new instruments such as the bond now proposed by Uruguay."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley <MS.N> real estate dealmaker was sentenced to nine months in prison on Thursday for skirting the bank's internal controls in an effort to enrich himself and a Chinese government official.

Garth Peterson, 43, had pleaded guilty in April to conspiring to evade internal accounting controls that Morgan Stanley was required to maintain under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

Peterson, a managing director in Morgan Stanley's real estate investment and fund advisory business in Shanghai, was fired in 2008 amid a probe into a suspect real estate deal, court records showed.

While federal investigators have increased efforts in recent years to enforce the FCPA, which is intended to thwart illicit payments to foreign officials, Peterson's case is among the first related to the financial services industry.

The sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York, was much shorter than the 51- to 60-month term sought by prosecutors.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn declined to comment.

During Thursday's sentencing hearing, Peterson apologized to his family and his former employer, saying he went down ""the wrong track"" when he entered a suspect real estate deal with an unnamed official from Yongye, a state-owned real estate investment corporation in Shanghai.

Prosecutors accused Peterson of helping the official and a Canadian lawyer they did not identify secretly buy a stake, at a discounted price, in a valuable Shanghai property owned by a Morgan Stanley fund.

In exchange, the official would help find investment opportunities for Morgan Stanley in China's real estate market, prosecutors said.

The discounted property stake was eventually worth nearly $5.4 million more than Peterson and his accomplices paid, prosecutors said.

Peterson was described by some colleagues as a rising star at Morgan Stanley before his termination, according to his pre-sentencing memorandum.

In court filings, Peterson said that he brought the official into the deal as an expression of ""guanxi"" - a Chinese custom referring to the exchange of favors in professional relationships.

But prosecutors said that Peterson used the deal to curry favor and turn a personal profit.

In April, Peterson settled a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. He agreed to never again work in the securities industry and to relinquish his share in the real estate deal, which was valued by the SEC in April at $3.4 million.

Morgan Stanley was not charged and said it cooperated with authorities. ""Mr. Peterson's intentional circumvention of Morgan Stanley's internal controls was a deliberate and egregious violation of our values and policies,"" Morgan Stanley spokesman Matt Burkhard said.

Judges often impose prison terms of less than one year in FCPA cases, and the Peterson case underscores the inability of prosecutors to win greater punishments, said Mike Koehler, an assistant professor of business law at Southern Illinois University School of Law.

""The DOJ speaks with very lofty rhetoric when it comes to FCPA enforcement, but judges don't seem to view the issue the same way,"" he said.

The case is U.S. v. Peterson, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00224.

3,"The breadth of Goldman Sachs’ corruption in the recent DOJ and SEC FCPA enforcement action underscored the important global goal of reducing corruption. It goes without saying – corruption has a pernicious impact on economic development of fragile economies to the detriment of thousands, if not millions, of innocent civilians. The measurement of such harms is often cited to describe the scope of suffering for many in the developing world.

Political and economic corruption warps government allocation of limited resources for the benefit of the public. Companies that are otherwise unqualified may secure valuable government contracts by paying bribes. Private businesses lose valuable investment and economic opportunities as corruption skews or frustrates the operation of market forces to promote economic development. In the end, all of these forces combine to undermine important government institutions, resulting in an overall lower standard of living.

The World Bank estimates that the average income in countries with a high level of corruption is approximately one-third of low corruption countries. The infant mortality rate in such countries is about three times higher and literacy rate is 25 percent lower.

Corrupt countries and economies experience lower levels of foreign investment than low corruption countries. Investors are reluctant to invest in high-risk corrupt countries.

Many emerging economies suffer from corruption and slow economic development. The impact of corruption results in an inefficient allocation of resources, frustration of market forces, and poor education and healthcare.

Malaysia and the Goldman Sachs Bribery Scandal

The Malaysian economy has been growing over the last decade. Since 2010, Malaysian economic growth has averaged 5.4 percent. Malaysia is in the midst of transforming from an agricultural and commodity-based economy to manufacturing and service-based economy. Malaysia is now a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts and components.

Income inequality, however, remains a significant problem. The bottom 40 percent of Malaysian citizens have not benefited at the same rate as the top 60 percent of the population. Malaysia is focused on promoting education, health and nutrition to increase worker health and productivity.

Corruption in Malaysia

Corruption has become a significant concern in Malaysia, primarily in response to the conviction of the first Malaysian leader for corruption in relation to the Goldman Sachs scandal.

Former Prime Minister Najib Razak was convicted of looting the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund while in office from 2009 to 2018. In response to his conviction, the Malaysian people rejected both Mr. Najib and his ruling party, which had governed Malaysia for 61 years since gaining independence from Great Britain.

At the center of this corruption was Goldman Sachs. The scheme was executed by former Goldman Sachs executives and Malaysian and Abu Dhabi government officials who stole over $6.5 billion in capital from the 1MDB fund.

Since 2018, Malaysia has embraced economic reforms for clean government. In 2019, Malaysia earned its highest rating under the Corruption Perception Index, a 53 score. Malaysia created an anti-corruption agency and set a five-year goal to increase integrity in the government. Nearly 1500 people have been charged with corruption offenses"
4,"* Shareholder and Investor Conference Call Scheduled for November 24, 2021

New York, Nov. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PHI Group, Inc. ( www.phiglobal.com , PHIL ), a company currently focused on PHILUX Global Funds, a group of Luxembourg bank funds, and developing the Asia Diamond Exchange (“ADE”) in Vietnam, is pleased to announce that CO2-1-0 (CARBON) Corp., a subsidiary of the Company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with SuperGreen Solutions ( https://supergreensolutions.com/ ) to cooperate in a new disruptive carbon mitigation program through worldwide environmentally sustainable projects.



According to the MOU, SuperGreen and CO2-1-0 (CARBON) will cooperate in acquiring carbon credits from SuperGreen’s projects and from other project owners in the United States of America. Carbon credits will be digitalized into Carbon Tokens using blockchain-crypto technology and deploying IoT.

SuperGreen will provide project data to be processed into CARBON’s data processing center and also support CARBON’s due diligence processes. SuperGreen will be CARBON’s exclusive representative for the entire United States of America market. As part of this strategic alliance, PHI Group has agreed to assist SuperGreen in raising the required finances to implement the overall scope of cooperation.

According to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), together with the Paris agreement and Kyoto protocol in 2016, Indonesia has actively participated and agreed to maintain the earth temperature not to exceed by 1,5 degrees Celsius by 2030. The greenhouse gases (GHG), mainly CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs, are the root cause of global climate change, each of which can be calculated as CER (CO2 Emission Reduction) equivalent.

Currently, CER is being tediously registered, validated, and certified centrally under UNFCCC methodology by a few independent institutions, mostly in the US and Europe, where the CER later can be traded (as carbon credits) voluntarily. For the past 5 years, the market for carbon credits has been nearly zero, and due to complexity of the processes, many companies/ projects have less appetite to be engaged in the carbon credit opportunity. Many environmentally sustainable projects (renewable energy/ waste/ agriculture/forestry/ etc.) have failed to get financial support especially at the initial/ development stage, due to the above reasons, causing less economic value of the project or delays.

The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International Finance (IIF) with knowledge support from McKinsey, estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Overall, the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion in 2030.

Daniel Dubell, CEO of SuperGreen Solutions, stated: “SuperGreen Solutions is proud to partner with CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP and PHI Group, Inc. in supporting the United States efforts to be the global leader in reaching Net Zero Carbon Emissions.”

Choky Simanjuntak, Founder and CEO of CARBON, added: “We are warm-hearted and delighted to work together with SuperGreen. Our carbon credits solution with blockchain-crypto technology and IoT will fuel thousands of SuperGreen projects and help The United States to reach net zero carbon target accordingly. This is a real action and real example on following up recent COP26-Glasgow which was also attended by President of The United States.

We also encourage qualified investors to participate in our CARBON token private sale in the coming weeks (starting December 1, 2021). This CARBON token sale will nourish the new carbon credit ecosystem. Therefore, we believe our mutual cooperation with SuperGreen may change the life of many people across the globe. Thank you and God bless!”

The Carbon Dividend is one of the three legs of our policy, so it’s important to get it right. CCL commissioned an expert study to address the implementation of the Dividend portion of the CCL proposal. The resulting paper, entitled “Paying Dividends to American Residents from Carbon Fee Revenue” analyzed two possible methods of paying out the Dividend, developed workflow and documentation methods, and explored several of the potential challenges that will be faced in achieving the program goals of getting Dividends to as many residents as possible with maximum transparency and minimum cost.

Highlights of the study

HIGHLIGHTS

Achieved consolidated year-over-year revenue growth of 7%

Higher North America bid season commitments drove increased Salt segment revenue year over year despite weaker winter weather in the quarter

Average sales price for the company's Protassium+ ® sulfate of potash (SOP) product strengthened to approximately $660 per ton, an increase of 5% sequentially and 20% year over year, supported by a strong fertilizer macro environment

sulfate of potash (SOP) product strengthened to approximately $660 per ton, an increase of 5% sequentially and 20% year over year, supported by a strong fertilizer macro environment Continued to advance company's lithium development; anticipate achieving additional milestones in 2022, including selecting a direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology provider as well as completing both a front-end-loaded (FEL-1) level engineering estimate of operating costs and capital intensity and a third-party life cycle assessment (LCA) of lithium development scenarios under consideration

Bolstered senior management team and board of directors through addition of key executives with deep industry and advanced battery supply chain experience, including Lorin Crenshaw, chief financial officer; Chris Yandell, head of lithium; and Gareth Joyce, independent director

Reduced fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $200 million to $235 million largely due to trends in the company's Salt segment, and reduced capital spending guidance by $25 million from prior expectations to $100 million to $110 million

1 Non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are provided in tables at the end of this press release.

“ Our expanded Salt commitments allowed us to deliver revenue growth during the quarter despite a slow start to the winter weather season, while positioning us to capitalize on the prospect of more normalized weather demand during the balance of the season,” said Kevin S. Crutchfield, president and CEO. “ We expect inflationary pressures and higher logistical costs to dampen our underlying earnings potential over the course of the fiscal year. In response, we are focused on offsetting these costs through continued pricing actions in our Plant Nutrition and consumer and industrial businesses, as well as throughout the upcoming highway salt bid season. Concurrently, as we advance our growth strategy into attractive, adjacent markets – lithium and next-generation fire retardants – I am confident these actions should result in attractive returns on capital, driving long-term value for shareholders.”

Fiscal 2022 first-quarter consolidated revenue grew 7% year over year, driven primarily by an increase in highway deicing sales volumes of 27%, a 9% improvement in consumer and industrial (C&I) sales volumes, and higher Plant Nutrition and C&I pricing. Operating earnings for fiscal 2022 first quarter decreased $7.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA was lower by $3.6 million year over year, primarily due to higher shipping and handling expenses and product costs.

SALT SEGMENT SUMMARY

Salt segment fiscal 2022 first-quarter revenue totaled $273.9 million, up 20% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a 3% decline in average sales price. Both the highway deicing and C&I businesses delivered volume growth, despite below average snow events in the company's primary North American markets during the reporting period. Salt segment average sales price was impacted by a 1% decline in highway deicing average sales price, partially offset by a 3% increase in C&I average sales price year over year. Broad-based price increases were implemented across most C&I product categories, primarily in response to the high-inflation environment.

Salt segment operating earnings in the fiscal 2022 first quarter decreased $5.1 million to $39.4 million year over year, while EBITDA fell $6.3 million to $55.6 million over the same period. Salt segment operating margin was 14% in the fiscal 2022 first quarter, down from 19% in the prior year, and EBITDA margin decreased to 20% from 27%, primarily due to higher distribution expenses and product costs.

Winter Weather Effect

As previously announced, Compass Minerals reported 29 snow events during the fiscal 2022 first quarter in the 11 cities the company tracks, compared to 45 snow events during the prior-year comparable period and the ten-year average of 41.9 events. The company estimates these variations from average winter weather had a negative impact on fiscal 2022 first-quarter sales and operating earnings, as detailed in the table below.

Estimated Effect of Winter Weather on Salt Segment Performance (dollars in millions) Three months ended December 31, 2021 2020 Favorable (unfavorable) to average weather: Sales $(22) to $(26) $(60) to $(70) Operating earnings $(5) to $(8) $(22) to $(27)

PLANT NUTRITION SEGMENT SUMMARY

Plant Nutrition segment fiscal 2022 first-quarter revenue totaled $54.6 million, down 30% year over year, driven by lower sales volumes, partially offset by a 20% increase in average sales price. Fiscal 2022 first-quarter operating earnings increased $6.2 million year over year to $9.5 million, primarily due to higher pricing and lower per-unit cash costs, while EBITDA totaled $18.3 million compared to $12.3 million in the prior-year period. Fiscal 2022 first-quarter operating margin was 17% compared to 4% in the prior year and EBITDA margin was 34% compared to 16% in the prior year, both driven primarily by higher pricing.

CASH FLOW

Net cash used in operating activities amounted to $14.3 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, up $1.0 million year over year.

Net cash used in investing activities was $41.2 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, up $18.2 million year over year, primarily driven by the initial payment for the previously announced acquisition of an additional ownership interest in Fortress North America, a next-generation fire retardant company. This was partially offset by $7.5 million less capital spending during the period compared to the prior-year period.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $63.3 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, up $41.2 million year over year, reflecting a combination of lower dividends paid and short-term borrowings to fund investing activities described above.

The company ended the quarter with $187.5 million of liquidity, which includes $28.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $158.6 million of availability under its $300 million revolving credit facility.

OUTLOOK

The company has lowered its fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to a range of $200 million to $235 million, largely due to trends in its Salt segment, and has lowered its fiscal 2022 first-half Salt segment EBITDA guidance to $120 million to $160 million. These trends include a combination of (i) higher shipping and distribution costs due to inflationary pressures primarily in the C&I business; (ii) a relatively weak start to winter; and (iii) higher costs to serve and position highway deicing products in certain of the company's southern U.S. markets, primarily due to an outage taken earlier than originally planned at the Cote Blanche mine. Plant Nutrition guidance remains unchanged. On a year-over-year basis, the company continues to expect SOP pricing strength in the fiscal 2022 first half to more than offset lower sales volumes, resulting in improved Plant Nutrition margins and profitability. The company reduced its capital expenditure guidance by $25 million to a range of $100 million to $110 million to offset inflationary pressures the company continues to experience and in line with its current earnings outlook, reflecting an agile capital allocation approach.

FISCAL 2022 Guidance (for continuing operations): 1H FY22 FY22 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $200 million to $235 million Salt Segment Volume 11.8 million to 12.8 million tons Revenue $590 million to $690 million EBITDA $120 million to $160 million Plant Nutrition Segment Volume 280,000 to 320,000 tons Revenue $85 million to $110 million EBITDA $25 million to $35 million Corporate Corporate and other expense1 $65 million to $70 million Interest expense $55 million to $60 million Depreciation, depletion and amortization $115 million to $120 million Capital expenditures $100 million to $110 million Effective tax rate 14% to 17% 1Excludes depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation.

Forward-Looking Statements and Other Disclaimers

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements about development of the company’s lithium resource, including DLE technology provider selection as well as completion of an FEL-1 engineering estimate and a third-party LCA; ability to capitalize on demand, offset costs, deliver returns and drive value; Salt segment trends; costs; inflation; pricing; and the company’s outlook for the first half of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2022, including its expectations regarding adjusted EBITDA, volume, revenue, EBITDA, corporate and other expense, interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, capital expenditures and tax rates. Forward-looking statements are those that predict or describe future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. We use words such as “may,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “likely,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “project,” “estimate” and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements or forward-looking information. These statements are based on the company’s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including without limitation (i) weather conditions, (ii) the cost and availability of transportation for the distribution of the company’s products and foreign exchange rates, (iii) pressure on prices and impact from competitive products, (iv) any inability by the company to successfully implement its strategic priorities or its cost-saving or enterprise optimization initiatives, (v) the risk that the company may not realize the expected financial or other benefits from the proposed development of its lithium mineral resource or its investment in Fortress North America, (vi) the timing and the outcome of the sale process for the company’s South America chemicals business, and (vii) impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For further information on these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect the company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the company’s Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the transition period ended Sept. 30, 2021 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021 filed or to be filed with the SEC, as well as the company's other SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect future events or developments, except as required by law. Because it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, this list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.

The company has completed an initial assessment to define the lithium resource at Compass Minerals’ existing operations in accordance with applicable SEC regulations, including Subpart 1300. Pursuant to Subpart 1300, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The company’s mineral resource estimates, including estimates of the lithium resource, are based on many factors, including assumptions regarding extraction rates and duration of mining operations, and the quality of in-place resources. For example, the process technology for commercial extraction of lithium from brines with low lithium and high impurity (primarily magnesium) is still developing. Accordingly, there is no certainty that all or any part of the lithium mineral resource identified by the company’s initial assessment will be converted into an economically extractable mineral reserve.

Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures, management uses a variety of non-GAAP financial measures described below to evaluate the company’s and its operating segments’ performance. While the consolidated financial statements provide an understanding of the company’s overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, management analyzes components of the consolidated financial statements to identify certain trends and evaluate specific performance areas.

Management uses EBITDA, EBITDA adjusted for items which management believes are not indicative of the company’s ongoing operating performance (“Adjusted EBITDA”), and EBITDA margin to evaluate the operating performance of the company’s core business operations because its resource allocation, financing methods and cost of capital, and income tax positions are managed at a corporate level, apart from the activities of the operating segments, and the operating facilities are located in different taxing jurisdictions, which can cause considerable variation in net earnings. Management also uses adjusted operating earnings, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which eliminate the impact of certain items that management does not consider indicative of underlying operating performance. The presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors with additional information that is helpful when evaluating underlying performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, each of which are an essential element of the company’s cost structure and cannot be eliminated. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude certain cash and non-cash items, including stock-based compensation. Consequently, any measure that excludes these elements has material limitations. The non-GAAP financial measures used by management should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, operating earnings, cash flows or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of overall profitability or liquidity. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. The calculation of non-GAAP financial measures as used by management is set forth in the following tables. All margin numbers are defined as the relevant measure divided by sales. The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, as the company is unable to estimate significant non-recurring or unusual items without unreasonable effort. The amounts and timing of these items are uncertain and could be material to the company’s results.

9,"CF Industries (NYSE: NYSE:CF) is one of the largest manufacturers of nitrogen-based fertilizers and nitrogen products in the US. The company has struggled with weak fertilizer pricing as a result of lower natural gas prices, and disappointing 3Q 2015 earnings led to a sell-off. The market is understandably concerned with CF's ability to maintain pricing power in a commoditized industry, demand from India, China, and Russia, and the recent increase in Chinese anthracite-based fertilizers in the US market as a result of lower shipping costs.

While investors were preoccupied with these macro-market concerns, CF executed two transactions that promise to grow the business and deliver value back to shareholders that were largely ignored by the market. In early August, CF and OCI (EA: OCI), a Dutch fertilizer manufacturer, agreed to a merger that would grow system-wide capacity to over 12.5mm tons at closing (2Q 2016), growing per share capacity by 18% for CF investors (Source: CF 8-K 8/6/15). The merger would also move the company's headquarters to the UK, and reduce corporate expense for the combined company.

Despite political positioning against such tax-inversions, the deal received U.S. clearance on Nov 2 - the deal still requires approval from both shareholders. A few days later, CF Industries entered into an agreement with CHS, a farming and agricultural cooperative (CHSCP), to supply 1.7mm tons, or 8.9% of system capacity (pre-OCI merger) and sell a minority stake in its nitrogen business for a combined $2.8bn (Source: CF 8-K 8/11/15). The transaction allows CHS to reap producer economics through dividends, while freeing up cash for CF shareholders. Despite the announcement of these two transactions, the stock has traded down 19.5% YTD on weak nitrogen pricing.

Although we are mindful of the market's nitrogen pricing concerns, we are confident in CF's core franchise and recent strategic transactions. Moreover, because information related to the CF-OCI merger was not released through the CF Investor Relations or OCI Investor Relations pages, but rather filed with the SEC under Darwin Holdings, the UK shell for New-CF, we believe the market may have missed the information release and may have a delayed reaction to the transaction specifics. We believe the combined company is worth $71, a 62.7% upside for current shareholders.

Nitrogen-Based Fertilizers Market

CF is one of the largest manufacturers of nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen is a key component of chlorophyll - the chemical responsible for photosynthesis - and the nucleobases in DNA. However, Nitrogen - in most forms - is not readily accessible to plants; they benefit from nitrogen fixing bacteria and legumes that turn gaseous N 2 in the atmosphere into usable NH 3 (ammonia). Nitrogen-based fertilizers accomplish the same process synthetically.

The Haber-Bosch process uses natural gas (CH 4 ) to supply the hydrogen and nitrogen (N 2 ) readily available in the air, and passes both of them through powdered metal catalysts at high temperature and high pressure to break the strong bonds of the N 2 , this process creates ammonia, which is the building block of all nitrogen-based fertilizer products.

Another method involves burning anthracite coal to release H+ ions, and then using a similar process to combine N 2 and H+ into ammonia. This process is incredibly wasteful and uncommon in the United States. Rather, anthracite-based production is the primary mode of production in China, and the cost of anthracite coal establishes a global floor on the price of fertilizer products.

Source: CF Industries 3Q 2015 Earnings Presentation

Nonetheless, US producers have benefited from low natural gas prices, which have placed them at the bottom of the cost curve. The $250-$285 cost floor per short ton was far lower than historical averages, largely due to the Chinese Yuan devaluation, less expensive coal and freight costs.

Although foreign importers can set the price floor at the market, US producers will always have a structural advantage over foreign importers because of inland transportation costs from Gulf stations to farms/terminals. The CF network has the largest distribution network in the US with over 6,000 rail cars, 32 river barges, and two company-owned pipelines that move 1.0mm tons.

This structural advantage is incredibly important when considering the competitive dynamics of the US fertilizer market: because CF and other US producers can always beat importers on inland pricing given lower inland transportation costs, they are unlikely to face excess supply concerns as the market can always absorb their production in lieu of purchasing more expensive imported products.

Of particular note in the international market is China's 2017 cap-and-trade program. Targeted towards industrial production, including chemicals, the program could have the effect of reducing the usage of coal in fertilizer production and either increase marginal cost because of the additional cost of emission cap credits, or force the market to transition to more expensive natural gas production: either way, the cap-and-trade program may drive long-term price increases if it is effectively administered.

Management is anticipating a stronger planting season, and has already booked orders for ammonia and UAN that support the expectation of stronger 2016 demand.

OCI N.V. Merger

OCI is a Dutch manufacturer of nitrogen-based fertilizers with 8.4mm metric tons of capacity. The proposed merger would give CF shareholders an interest in OCI's Geleen, Netherlands and Weaver, Iowa nitrogen production facilities, Beaumont, TX ammonia and methanol production complex, and global distribution facilities and business in Dubai, UAE - collectively known as the ""ENA"" businesses, as well as the option to purchase 45% of Natgasoline - a greenfield methanol project in Beaumont, TX under development. The deal would exclude some of OCI's other businesses. The merger would give the combined company over 25.1mm tons of capacity in 2017, and supply 31% of US fertilizer demand (Source: CF Industries/Morgan Stanley Chemicals and Agriculture Conference 11/9/15).

The deal is accretive to CF because of operational synergies and growth opportunities. The merger will leverage the scale of both companies' existing production businesses, and allow CF a greater foothold into the international market. OCI's Dubai distribution center and European operations complement CF's recent acquisition of GrowHow, a UK-based fertilizer manufacturer - creating organic growth runways into the European market. The expanded international presence and production expansion - from both the OCI merger and plant expansions at CF's Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities - will further CF's growth. Management has announced $500mm in after-tax annual run-rate synergies (Source: CF 8-K 8/6/15).

According to CF's transaction announcement, OCI will contribute its European, North American, and Dubai-based distribution businesses to the New-CF in exchange for 25.6% of New-CF and $700mm in a mixture of cash and New-CF shares. New-CF will also have the right to purchase 45% of Natgasoline (OCI's methanol production facility in Beaumont, TX) for $500mm in cash. CF's management anticipates that current CF shareholders will own 243.3mm shares out of 324.2mm shares in New-CF (72.3%), with the final split dependent on the price of CF's share price (Source: CF 8-K 8/6/15) and price of OCI's 3.875% convertible bonds (Source: Darwin S-4 11/6/15). The S-4 filing indicates that current CF shareholders will own 71.9% of New-CF before adjusting for OCI's convertible bonds. Goldman Sachs' analysis indicates that CF is paying 7.6x EV/2016E EBITDA including expected synergies, and 11.6x EV/EBITDA excl. synergies.

The S-4 filing presents an unaudited pro-forma combined income statement for New-CF, including the effects of the GrowHow JV acquisition and CHS deal as if they had taken place on January 1st. The transactions incorporated into the pro-forma combined statements also increase the company's 1H2015 net debt from $3.8bn to $4.8bn ($14.74/unit to $13.87/unit), but also increase cash from $809.9mm to $3,490.5bn ($3.16/unit to $10.02/unit). For Y/E 2014, the combined company would have generated $7.2bn in annual sales, $2.2bn gross profit (31.4% margin New-CF vs. 35.8% CF incl. GrowHow), and $1.9bn operating profit (26.0% margin New-CF vs. 32.6% CF incl. GrowHow, excl. sale of phosphate business).

These pro-forma figures do not include any synergies from the transaction, although management expects $500mm of annual synergies by 2018 from cost savings, capital structure savings, and tax benefits. CF's financial advisors suggested that the equity value of the synergies through 2019 could be worth between $4.2bn and $7.2bn (Source: Pg. 97 Darwin S-4 11/6/15). Given the benefits of the transaction,

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs calculated a range of illustrative values per New CF ordinary share on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the transactions and the synergies of $75 per share to $117 per share [at the end of 2019] … and a range of implied present values of … $67 to $106 for New CF on a pro forma basis (Source: Pg. 97 - 98 Darwin S-4 11/6/15)

The private side of the market understands CF's long-term value, despite short-term pricing pressures, and assigns a 53% to 141% premium. This analysis is tucked away in a 700+ page document, instead of on the front page of an equity research report, which explains why it has not received more coverage or acknowledgment from the market.

Independent Valuation

The private market assigns a far higher value to CF Industries than the public market does. We believe this is because CF's financial advisors have a better understanding of the business, have an intimate understanding of the merger and potential synergies, and more access to management than equity research analysts. Nonetheless, we believe some of the assumptions made in these calculations are optimistic, and we have generated our own projections for the value of the business.

The driver behind CF's earnings is its ammonia production capacity: CF can offer lower all-in cost because of its in-land US network, which reduces transportation costs to end-users. In comparison, buyers of international fertilizer products have to pay for additional shipping from the Gulf terminal. For this reason, we believe the ceiling on CF's earnings is established by production capacity and price.

The combined capacity of CF and OCI in 2015 is 21.2mm short tons, which we project will grow to 29.0mm short tons by 2017, given management's projections (Source: Pg. 289 Darwin S-4 11/6/15). At our projected price of $325/short ton in 2017, a 21% tax rate, and our own projections of 16% synergy realization and 38% Operating Margin, we project $2.2bn in post-tax earnings, or a present value $56 share price assuming no growth and a 10% discount rate. This represents a 28% premium with no growth and prices below their long-term average.

Management has indicated that returning capital to shareholders is a priority for them through 2019. Oversupply in the fertilizer market makes it a poor time to reinvest cash into plants, and management expects to execute additional share buybacks using unallocated cash (CHS Announcement Conference Call Presentation). Management expects to have $10.0bn of unallocated cash, after CapEx (Source: CF Industries/Morgan Stanley Chemicals and Agriculture Conference 11/9/15), but we anticipate that this number is generous given the company's growth aspirations. We adjusted this number downwards to $3.5bn, given management's pro-forma estimate cash on hand as of June 30, 2015 (Source: Pg. 280 Darwin S-4 11/6/15). If management repurchases $3.5bn of stock at $50.00/share, we believe the intrinsic value of each share increases to $71 - this represents a 63% upside.

If we do accept management's estimate of $10.0bn unallocated cash - which is incredibly optimistic, and management repurchases $3.5bn of stock and distributes the remaining $6.5bn as dividends, the stock will be worth $97 - if the company repurchases an aggregate of $10.0bn stock, the stock will be worth $146. However, we believe these assumptions are too aggressive, and are comfortable with our $71 estimate.

Investment Considerations

We believe there are three main investment considerations to examine before purchasing CF Industries: first, if long-term coal prices remain low in China, the Urea cost curve will remain depressed; second, merger synergies may not materialize; and third, as highlighted by Citigroup in a recent report, new IRS rules regarding inversions may limit the company's ability to achieve a lower tax rate.

Long-term coal prices may remain lower than the historical average; as growth tempers to < 7% YoY, Chinese demand for anthracite coal will slow. The slowing demand for coal, and decline in prices, will inadvertently place downwards pressure on the global price floor. This may be moderated by 9.4% YoY coal demand growth in India, and the implementation of a cap-and-trade system in China.

Estimated 16%-18% merger synergies may not materialize, but we feel confident in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs' analyses. Our analysis projects 16% synergies in 2017, but we believe that management, which has a long track record of delivering value to shareholders (CF has returned 1100% to shareholders since inception), will be able to deliver on the projected synergies.

Citigroup highlighted recent changes to the IRS rules regarding tax inversions, which may affect CF's ability to reincorporate in the UK, as neither company is British. The new IRS rules,

1) Places limits on U.S. companies combining with foreign companies using a new foreign parent located in a ""third country,"" 2) Limits the ability of U.S. companies to bypass the 80-percent ownership rule (in the proposed deal, CF would own ~72% of the new company and OCI ~28%); and 3) Requires the new foreign parent to be a tax resident of the country where it is created or organized. Additionally, and retroactive to 2014, the IRS will limit the benefits of transferring assets to foreign parent companies tax-free. (Source: Citigroup 11/20/15)

Although this is a material risk, we believe that CF could reincorporate in the Netherlands, where the corporate tax rate is 25% - higher than the UK's 21%, but lower than the US's 35%. We believe that at a 25% tax rate, the company would be worth a present value of $53 without share buybacks and $68 with share buybacks, still a 21% premium over Friday's close.

Conclusion

Post-merger, CF Industries will be the largest fertilizer manufacturer in the world - and despite pricing pressures that have captured market attention in the short term, the company is on-track to generate $6.78 2017E EPS, nearly twice TTM $3.80 EPS. We believe that the market is concerned with short-term pricing pressures, and ignoring the long-term strategic strengths of CF Industries. More importantly, the private market is valuing CF for 71% to 141% of its current price, and we believe the market is ignoring this information.

Altogether, we believe that CF Industries is worth $56-$72, with downside protection considering the $3.5bn projected post-merger cash position and standalone CF's strong cash generation, which will help management return value to shareholders if the merger falls through. CF is an asymmetric return opportunity given the discount at which investors can enter the standalone business, 11.6x TTM P/E, which is itself one of the world's largest fertilizer producers with numerous competitive advantages in the US market and a strong pipeline of new supply. CF is a strong buy for us, and we expect to realize 70%+ return over the next 24 months."
10,"Zero waste is a low-hanging fruit solution that helps cities achieve their climate goals affordably and effectively.

As America’s climate commitments have floundered in the face of a rising existential threat, city leaders have increasingly stepped up to the plate to deliver the kind of transformative change we need to avert climate catastrophe. But cities have also been slammed, especially in the last few years, with other urgent challenges. The pandemic exacerbated existing crises of equity – access to affordable housing, healthcare, and decent jobs for all, as well as environmental pollution – that left low-income and BIPOC communities particularly vulnerable to COVID’s worst outcomes.

The climate solutions that cities pursue must not only quickly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but also address the complex and interconnected social, political, and economic realities that we face. And sometimes we find solutions where we least expect it: like in our garbage bin.



“Zero waste,” namely the reduction, separate collection, composting, and recycling of our trash, is a low-hanging fruit solution that helps cities achieve their climate goals affordably and effectively. In the U.S., 42% of GHG emissions are associated with the making, using, and wasting of stuff. Plastic in particular is a deadly material for the climate. The GHG emissions from plastic production and destruction is on track to surpass the power sector’s climate footprint.

A new report released by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) found that waste reduction and better management could reduce waste sector GHG emissions by 84%, or 1.4 billion tons. That’s like taking all motor vehicles off the road in the U.S. for a year. Composting, in particular, would prevent the 20% of global methane emissions that come from putting our organic waste in a landfill. This organics recovery strategy is of particular importance because methane is 80 times as powerful of a GHG as carbon dioxide.

There is also evidence that zero waste strategies can help the waste sector prevent more GHG’s than it emits. The study found that through modest zero waste strategies like scaling up recycling and composting programs, cities like Detroit, MI, could achieve net negative emissions in the sector by 2030. Given Detroit’s current levels of recycling and composting–which thanks to dedicated community groups, small businesses, and policymakers, is growing but still very low–this modeling shows that the same astonishing GHG reduction potential is within reach in cities across the United States.

Zero waste strategies are much more affordable than conventional waste disposal methods. A recent study found that cities could save an average of 70% on waste management costs by transitioning to zero waste systems.

In contrast, waste incineration is the most costly approach to municipal waste: incinerators are extremely expensive to build, and once they are built, they demand a high tonnage of waste in order to keep the facility operational, discouraging cities from pursuing waste reduction strategies. Some cities have even been driven to bankruptcy due to investments in the incinerator, most notably Harrisburg, PA and Detroit, MI.

Zero waste can also help bring about a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Studies have found that zero waste systems create up to 200 times as many jobs as disposal methods like landfilling and incineration. And even more importantly, a healthy zero waste system can create well-paying, union jobs that provide a decent wage, benefits, and safe working conditions. The San Francisco-based unionized, worker-owned waste management company Recology, for example, has an 80% recovery rate, and offers a starting salary of $40 per hour, in contrast to the average waste hauler’s income of $16 per hour in the state.

As recent studies have uncovered the severity of the United State’s environmental pollution problem and its impact on public health, cities have begun to recognize the critical importance of protecting communities from this threat. It seems like there’s a new headline every month about the hazards of plastic– plastic in our food, plastic in our water, plastic in the human placenta, plastic in our blood. Burning our waste makes things even worse– it not only turns garbage into GHG emissions, but also into toxic air emissions of mercury, lead, dioxins, and particulate matter that can impact our organs.

For years the community living near the Detroit incinerator – 87% of whom are people of color and children– were five times more likely to be admitted to a hospital for asthma. The incinerator burned the waste of more affluent communities outside of the city, as well as that of communities from other states and even Canada, and it is estimated that the facility caused $2.6 million in health costs each year.

After four decades of tireless community activism, the Detroit incinerator was finally shut down. Now the very same communities that had once lived under the shadow of the incinerator are piloting a community composting program along with neighboring communities on the Eastside of Detroit for backyard, community garden, and urban farm scales.

Many other waste prevention and diversion projects, such as education campaigns to increase participation in Detroit’s growing curbside recycling program, compost collection, textile upcycling, food rescue and redistribution, and electronics repurposing, are taking place all at the same time. These projects provide a blueprint for the city on how decentralized waste diversion efforts could prevent further pollution and improve well-being across Detroit.

In the face of ever-worsening unnatural disasters, zero waste systems are a critical tool to further climate adaptation in cities. In particular, separately collecting and composting organic discards has a powerful impact on local agricultural systems. Not only does compost boost the productivity of the soil, but it also makes crops more resilient to climate instability like droughts and floods, making soil better able to both retain nutrients, and absorb and detoxify floodwaters. This is a boon to both local farmers and community members, creating a closed loop system where food is grown, delivered to communities, and any waste is returned to the soil to grow more healthy food. Reduction of single-use plastic has also been proven to help mitigate flooding, as plastic bags and other items have a tendency to clog storm drains.

Detroit’s local composting initiatives, like the Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC), are prime examples of climate resilience in action. The Collective has become an organics drop-off site for local residents. Food scraps are composted and returned to the soil of the on-site community garden, which founder Mark Covington uses to grow nutritious foods for his neighbors. In just under two years, the Collective has prevented upward of 25,000 pounds of organics from a local university from being landfilled.



The scale of the climate crisis is often difficult to grasp, and many of our leaders still fail to identify climate change as the cause or amplifier of the many challenges that we’re facing. However, waste is literally easy to grasp, in fact we are in contact with it on a daily basis– when we throw it away, when we see it littering our public spaces, and certainly when we smell it. Successful city efforts to reduce and better manage waste are largely community-led, in part because when people are confronted with the waste crisis in a tangible way, they are more likely to take action, and to achieve tangible results. In this way, zero waste is a winning climate strategy that can create good jobs, save public funds, and build healthier communities."
11,"While even the strongest economies are hardly impervious to climate impacts, these events often instigate an especially complex chain of disasters for marginalized communities, where they can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. We’ve seen this play out in the U.S.—where nearly six out of 10 Americans don’t have $1,000 in savings to cover an unplanned expense—but such situations can be even worse in developing countries, as illustrated by the ongoing emergency that erupted in Mozambique in the wake of Cyclone Idai.

Indeed, climate change is a game changer—one that sometimes leaves governments, businesses and communities struggling to find and understand the new rulebook. The past is no longer a reliable indicator of what the future will bring. The scientific community understands this well and has important data, knowledge and approaches that will be critical to help governments and other organizations develop cost-effective and appropriate responses.

But in order to leverage this knowledge efficiently, it is essential to maintain the channels by which this information is shared and utilized for the public good. This is the mission that brought about the Science for Climate Action Network (SCAN) in April of this year. The network arose out of a study undertaken by the Independent Advisory Committee for Applied Climate Assessment, a committee that formed when the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump canceled the federal advisory commission established to provide regular climate assessments. Upon its cancellation, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Columbia University and the American Meteorological Society stepped forward to support an independent committee to carry on with the same purpose—facilitating the promotion of climate adaptation and resilience."

The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) has issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a transit-oriented development (TOD) at the Bankhead Station, the western terminus of the Green Line.

Georgia recently allocated $6 million for upgrades to the station, which is next to a proposed 90-acre hub for the Microsoft Corp., one of the tech giant's largest, Progressive Railroading reported.

MARTA's development will be located on approximately 5.5 acres. The state hopes that the station will continue to reinforce Microsoft's economic development potential in the area, and the critical role transit plays in that growth.

The city of Atlanta's overarching TOD plan involves rezoning nine MARTA rail stations to support higher density. MARTA will go to the Atlanta City Council for approval on the Bankhead station in March, according to a press release from the transit agency.

The Bankhead Station is located within one of Atlanta's 26 Federal Opportunity Zone Program areas. The program supports the stimulation of economic development by incentivizing long-term investment in low-income neighborhoods.

One MARTA stipulation for the new development requires that 30 percent of residential units will be available to people earning 80 to 120 percent of the area median household income by ZIP code.

""Bankhead Station is in a part of Atlanta that is undergoing significant growth and land use changes,"" explained MARTA Interim General Manager Collie Greenwood in the press release. ""Our rezoning efforts with the city and the station's location within a Federal Opportunity Zone make this TOD an incredible opportunity to provide affordable housing and other community amenities convenient to transit.""

The RFP process will span the next few months, noted What Now Atlanta, an online community news source, and began in early February with a pre-proposal conference, a question-and-answer session on Feb. 9, and full proposals due on April 13.

Partnerships to Preserve Affordable Housing

The Bankhead rail station will be located at 1335 Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway, adjacent to the proposed Microsoft campus, and a half-mile southeast of the newly opened Westside Park. Other nearby developments include the Atlanta BeltLine Westside Trail and the Proctor Creek Greenway in the historic Grove Park community.

According to documents prepared by MARTA, in response to community concerns over displacement caused by new growth in the region, the transit agency and Morgan Stanley Community Development Finance, along with its partner, the National Equity Fund, established a $100 million fund to preserve existing affordable units around heavy rail stations and the Atlanta Streetcar.

In addition, to bring more affordable housing and Federal Opportunity Zone capital to bear on new TODs, What Now Atlanta reported that MARTA recently partnered with Goldman Sachs on a $100 million affordable housing initiative. As a result, developers proposing the Bankhead Station TOD will have more options for capital sources for their proposed projects.

""This allows MARTA to deliver the housing affordability desired by the surrounding community and meet the city of Atlanta's affordable housing goals as well as meet and exceed our own,"" Greenwood said in the MARTA news release. ""We are eager to see the proposals for this unique site as we undergo our own transformative work planned for Bankhead Station.""

The agency's MARTA 2040 plan, which is a decades-long, multibillion-dollar investment in transit improvement and expansion in Atlanta, includes the Bankhead Station platform extension from two-car to eight-car capacity and other changes to accommodate growing demand for rail service.

13,"Since becoming president, Trump has breezily ignored the emoluments clause of the Constitution, handed taxpayers a multimillion-dollar bill for his frequent trips to his own properties, appointed his daughter and son-in-law to sensitive positions for which they are manifestly unqualified, and surrounded himself with a host of shady characters. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and several other campaign advisors has been convicted of fraud or other crimes, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has been convicted of lying to the FBI, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke both resigned over ethics violations. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta is under fire for the plea deal he gave the wealthy and well-connected accused sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein back when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross continues to serve despite serious conflicts of interest.

Since 2016, of course, concern for corruption has been riveted on the sleaze show that is the Trump administration. As the New York Times revealed last fall in a remarkable investigative report , U.S. President Donald Trump’s life since boyhood has rested on assorted frauds, tax scams, and shady business dealings, and his recent conduct suggests high office did not alter the family’s modus operandi.

If they’ve been paying attention, Americans have received some rude wake-up calls in recent years. What unpleasant news do these messages convey? The country is a lot more corrupt than Americans realized.

Instead of fulfilling his campaign promise to “drain the swamp,” Trump dug it wider and filled it deeper. Small wonder that the United States has fallen out of the ranks of the top 20 “least corrupt” nations—according to the watchdog group Transparency International—and is now considered a “country to watch” by that nonpartisan organization.

But the problem is in fact far more serious than Trump and his entourage. Consider some other recent scandals.

Example #1: The 2008 Financial Crisis. To some extent, the 2008 financial crisis is a case study of hubris, where self-styled “masters of the universe” convinced themselves they had devised financial instruments that had reduced the risk of a panic to miniscule levels. But the crisis also exposed systemic corruption inside key financial institutions. It wasn’t just a few crooked mortgage brokers offering lots of bad loans; it also involved serious abuses by ratings agencies, investment banks, government-backed lenders like Fannie Mae, and even some academic economists. At least we can take comfort in the fact that the people responsible for cratering the world economy were held accountable and got punished, right? Er, nope.

Example #2: The Boeing 737 Max. The more we learn about the second recent crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the more disturbing the tale becomes. While a final determination of the causes of the two recent crashes has yet to be made, it seems increasingly clear that Boeing rushed the new plane to market, downplayed the need for additional pilot training, and used an increasingly cozy relationship with Federal Aviation Administration regulators to win approval for the plane. The world seems to have woken up to the conflicts of interest here: The United States was the last country to ground the plane after this month’s crash, and Ethiopian authorities chose to send the black boxes for analysis in France rather than in the United States.

Example #3: The (Latest) College Admissions Scandal. It’s no secret that admission to elite institutions of higher education isn’t the pure meritocracy that universities try to convey. Being part of an alumni family (a “legacy”) is a big plus, and it seems to help a lot if a parent gives the school a big donation at just the right time. But last week’s revelations that wealthy parents and celebrities were colluding with William Singer (a professional “admissions counselor”) and a bunch of corrupt coaches and administrators to get their less-than-fully-qualified kids into elite schools by falsifying test results or passing them off as gifted athletes was still an eye-opener. It was also more evidence—as if any were needed—of the corrupting role big-time athletics play in the life of American universities. Don’t even get me started on that subject.

And let’s not forget that a number of venerated institutions in American life—including the military and the clergy—have been rocked by serious scandals over the past several decades. In addition to the horrifying history of sexual predation and cover-ups in the Catholic Church, the U.S. military has been wrestling with a serious problem of sexual assault in the ranks, a wide-ranging procurement scandal that rocked the U.S. Navy, and the discovery in 2014 that 34 missile launch control officers conspired to falsify scores on proficiency exams. What these and other episodes reminds us is that corruption isn’t confined to the current White House, to a few bad apples like Bernie Madoff, or to a handful of industries with unsavory reputations (like real estate). On the contrary, it seems to be a growing problem in all walks of life.

Why does this matter? For starters, corruption is inherently inefficient. Instead of resources going where they are most needed, they get diverted into bribes, payoffs, kickbacks, and other shady arrangements. And when the wealthy and powerful use connections to get jobs or contracts (or to get their kids into college), that means that more deserving and talented people get excluded and less qualified people end up in positions of authority. The more common such practices become, the more honest and law-abiding people will be tempted to follow suit just to keep up. And once corruption becomes endemic in a society, rooting it out becomes difficult if not impossible.

Making matters worse is the demand for regulation that corruption tends to foster. When more and more people cheat and trust erodes, responsible officials will try to corral corruption by imposing more rules, laws, oversight procedures, and regulatory mechanisms. One sees this phenomenon everywhere—including at universities—where efforts to prevent all sorts of misconduct are making it nearly impossible to do anything efficiently. But the taproot of this problem is the fear that we cannot trust anyone to act properly without strict guidance and suffocating levels of bureaucratic oversight. Sadly, such fears are far from groundless.

Corruption and other forms of elite malfeasance also nourish populist anger. When elites go to great lengths to game the system and are increasingly seen as out of touch and unaccountable, it is hardly surprising that ordinary people who have been playing by the rules become so angry that they will put their faith in anyone who promises to shake up the system. Such sentiments help explain the otherwise surprising popularity of a candidate like Bernie Sanders or the rapid rise of straight-talking politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ironically, it also played a key role in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, which proved that if you can fake integrity, you’ve got it made.

Over the longer term, rising corruption threatens America’s soft power, and especially its reputation for competence. Other countries are more likely to follow America’s lead when they believe the core institutions of U.S. society are run by people who know what they are doing, and when foreign governments have confidence that the information provided by U.S. officials is accurate. But when grifters rule the roost and privileged elites use their current positions to hog even more for themselves, their offspring, and their cronies, our core institutions will function poorly and other states will lose confidence in our ability to deliver as promised.

To be sure, the United States still ranks relatively low on most indices of corruption, and it is a far cry from those unfortunate places where corrupt practices are almost a way of life. But we Americans are not nearly as pure as we pretend, or as concerned about the problem as we ought to be. And as long as Donald J. Trump is alligator-in-chief, life in the swamp will go on as before."
14,"You would have thought news was slow on Wall Street last week, when the hottest item on the ticker was that television personality Maria Bartiromo was jumping from CNBC, her onscreen home for two decades, to the Fox Business Channel.

Financial and media pundits struggled to place the event in cosmic context. Michael Wolff of the Guardian called it a “tectonic shift,” which was a bit of an overstatement even for him, though it’s possible he was being facetious. (It’s sometimes hard to tell.)

What was notable in all the turbocharged media coverage was how Bartiromo’s journalistic chops were described. Virtually every article focused on one particular career achievement: her having been the first reporter to broadcast from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Advertisement

Bartiromo has spoken of the physical challenges of this breakthrough, in which she was bodily knocked about by brokers rushing from one place to another on what was then a very frenetic, crowded trading floor. (It’s less so now, what with electronic trading having taken over the stock market.) Her participation in what was essentially a publicity stunt not only for the Big Board but her employer was presented as tantamount to penetrating a rebel compound in Southern Sudan and reporting under fire from the front.

This is not to say that Bartiromo isn’t talented as, well, television talent. Projecting coolness and grace day in and day out from a broadcast studio or booth, as she does, requires genuine skill. But Bartiromo’s career does point to some truths about CNBC and its role in financial journalism, such as it is, that are worth pondering.

First and most important, CNBC isn’t really a business news service for the average investor, though that’s how it pitches itself. It is and always has been a service for traders, who are nothing like investors. Traders have very short investing horizons, have to move fast, and often don’t make their decisions on corporate fundamentals like balance sheets, cash flow and the potential for profit or loss.

That’s something that Jon Stewart got fundamentally wrong in his celebrated takedown of CNBC and its star personality Jim Cramer back in 2009. Stewart ridiculed CNBC for recommending that viewers buy, say, Bear Stearns stock one day and reversing its recommendation a few weeks later. What he didn’t understand was that for investors this is terrible advice, but for traders it’s perfectly rational.

That should have been the response delivered by Cramer when he appeared on Stewart’s “Daily Show” -- but by then CNBC itself had probably forgotten that its real audience was traders. Still, it gives the game away by devoting so much attention during the day to market technicians, who chart stock movements searching for patterns. Investors with longtime horizons don’t bother with such alchemy. But it’s why the one CNBC show I find tolerable is its afternoon program “Fast Money” -- it features a daily panel of traders who admit they’re traders and talk unabashedly about how they’ve traded the day’s events.

The other issue with CNBC, and the one more relevant to Maria Bartiromo’s career, is the extent that it’s been co-opted by the corporate community. “Co-opted” may be the wrong term -- CNBC may never have been independent or objective in the traditional journalistic sense. In recent years, however, the network certainly seems to have abandoned almost all pretense of aggressive journalism.

The best example of this may be Bartiromo’s appearance with Alex Pareene of Salon.com, who should win the prize as the reporter least likely to be featured on a CNBC segment. Pareene was brought on to defend his argument that Jamie Dimon should be fired as JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, given the record of corruption he’s presided over at the big bank. (We’ve covered that issue here and here.) Openly scandalized at the very suggestion, Bartiromo scoffed at evidence of Morgan’s corruption, even though the bank has acknowledged much of it in public documents and its own annual reports.

This isn’t the behavior of a financial journalist. It’s the behavior of a television interviewer whose trick for snagging interviews with big-name CEOs and global investment gurus is the guarantee that she’ll always take them at their own level of self-esteem.

Bartiromo is a master (mistress?) of lobbing soft-balls at self-important targets. But that’s exactly what diminishes CNBC’s value as a news source, except for breaking events that can be reduced to the crawl at the bottom of the screen -- the reason most TVs tuned to CNBC during the market day have their sound turned off is that the blather from anchors often isn’t worth hearing. For a news channel like CNBC, a personality like Bartiromo is a necessary adornment. Her efforts at communicating anything that resembles trenchant analysis are often risible; consider this appearance last year on Tavis Smiley’s PBS program, in which her delivery was a combination of incoherence and received wisdom.

But you don’t turn to Maria Bartiromo for the sort of journalism that’s defined as finding out things your sources don’t want you to know, any more than her broadcasting from the NYSE floor was something the Big Board really didn’t want to happen.

At Fox Business Channel, she’ll be able to puff up her CEO interview subjects even more openly than she could at CNBC, and repeat big business’s positions on taxation and regulation with even greater abandon, because they’re openly shared by her new employers. But if you’re an investor or just an ordinary American looking for news you can use about what’s happening in the business world, you won’t get it from either channel."
15,"T-Mobile Inc. on Monday joined a deluge of big U.S. corporations borrowing in the bond market this September as Wall Street braces for another jumbo-sized rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

The three-part bond offering from T-Mobile US TMUS, +0.60% came at lower costs for the communication’s giant than initially anticipated, even as new debt issuance this year in the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market has neared the $1 trillion mark, according to Goldman Sachs data.

After seeing some $13 billion in demand for the bond deal, T-Mobile ended up paying investors a spread of 185 basis points above the Treasury rate on $1.25 billion of 10-year bonds, according to Informa Global Markets.

That was significantly less than initial price talk in the 220 basis point area, while robust demand also helped the borrower dial back borrowing costs on its 30-year and 40-year classes of bonds, according to Informa.

The financing followed a brisk $52.5 billion pace of borrowing by investment-grade companies last week, a pace that likely helped contribute to a big jump in U.S. Treasury yields (see chart) last week, according to BofA Global.

T-Mobile deal adds to September deluge of debt issuance BofA Global Research

The chart shows that Treasury yields have been vulnerable in the past to big weeks of corporate debt issuance. Other major companies to issue corporate bonds in September have been Equifax Inc. EFX, -0.28% , John Deere Capital Corp. DE, +2.40% , Target Corp TGT, -0.79% and Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.55% , according to BofA Global.

“We are seeing very, very heavy supply,” said Matt Brill, head of North America Investment Grade at Invesco, by phone, while noting that September often ends up a top month for bond issuance each year.

Both investors and issuers have been planning for a spike in issuance before the Fed likely pulls the trigger next week on another large rate increase.

“Everyone wants to be out in front of the Fed,” Brill said, adding that the string of outsized rate increases in 2022 has helped push yields in the investment-grade bond sector to an 12-year high of about 5%, but also risk sparking market volatility.

$14 billion share buyback program

In a public filing on Monday, T-Mobile said the new debt could be used to fund its stock repurchase program, refinancings and for other general corporate purposes.

Last week, the company detailed a $14 billion share buyback plan, at a time when the volume of share repurchases this year was pegged near $800 billion, or below last year’s record.

T-Mobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The 10-year Treasury rate TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.737% was near 3.4% on Monday, climbing toward its one-year high of almost 3.5%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s helped push the yield on the ICE BofA US Corporate Index to about 5% from a pandemic low of about 1.8%, even as companies rush to borrower before it becomes debt becomes even more expensive.

At next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting officials are expected to raise the central bank’s benchmark policy rate another 75 basis points, as part of its plans to cool inflation by getting borrowing costs nearer to 4% by year-end.

Stocks ended higher Monday for a fourth straight day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.50% finishing 0.7% higher, S&P 500 index SPX, +0.22% closing up 1.1% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.61% posting a 1.3% gain.

Investors also will be watching for Tuesday’s release of August inflation data, the closely tracked consumer-price index, with many on Wall Street expecting inflation to slowing pull back from a near 4-decade high over the next six months, but while still remaining well above the Fed’s 2% annual target.

By Trevor Hunnicutt

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors are not rewarding companies for generating good earnings consistently, opting instead for a stockpicking strategy that might be called ""growth at a high cost.""

High-quality stocks selected for their strong balance sheets and stable earnings have appreciated just 12 percent this year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc , while the broader S&P 500 <.SPX> benchmark index has returned 13.8 percent.

But investors cannot seem to stop throwing money at companies improving their sales fastest: a group of such equities tracked by Goldman Sachs has surged 20 percent. Put another way, discriminating investors who have chosen companies with stable earnings prospects are being punished.

This lagging interest in quality stocks has even whipsawed well-known fund managers; Whitney Tilson said this week he was shutting down his Kase Capital Management LLC hedge fund.

""Historically, I have invested in high-quality, safe stocks at good prices as well as lower-quality ones at distressed prices,"" Tilson wrote to investors.

""Given the high prices and complacency that currently prevail in the market, however, my favorite safe stocks (like Berkshire Hathaway and Mondelez ) don't feel cheap, and my favorite cheap stocks (like Hertz and Spirit Airlines ) don't feel safe. Hence, my decision to shut down.""

Yet some managers are betting that complacent markets could be shaken from their zombie-like slumber as easy monetary policy and its backdrop of lower interest rates comes to an end.

""In an environment like we're in now - where no one really cares what things are worth - you may underperform, but over time reality will set in,"" said Sean O'Hara, director at Pacer Financial Inc. ""It always does.""

REVERSAL OF STIMULUS

O'Hara said quality investments underperform when investors are willing to buy stocks without regard to their value, and that markets have been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinarily loose policies.

Earlier this month, the Fed, as expected, said it would begin to reverse some of those policies by gradually reducing its bond holdings.

Pacer Financial is one of a several investment firms betting that quality will matter again. Its ""Cash Cows"" ETFs buy companies with strong cash flows and healthy balance sheets.

Goldman Sachs' global investment research unit included companies such as retailer Ross Stores Inc , pharmacist CVS Health Corp and oil driller Schlumberger NV in its high-quality group earlier this year.

Yet these companies have mostly not been star performers.

The market has been led by so-called ""FANG"" stocks - like Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc , Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc - and a small winner's circle of lesser-known names like Celgene Corp and Equinix Inc .

These companies have all enjoyed robust sales growth in a U.S. economy that's below its boiling point, even as many factors disqualify some of them as quality stocks. Netflix has had 12 straight quarters of negative free cash flow, and the company warned it may not see positive free cash flow ""for many years"" as it invests in original content like the science-fiction drama ""Stranger Things.""

Still, its subscriber growth continues to exceed estimates, and the stock has rocketed more than 45 percent this year.

LUXURY OF GROWTH

Investors are paying a premium for the luxury of revenue growth: $24 for every dollar of earnings per share anticipated over the next 12 months, compared to $20 for quality names and $13 for high adjusted free-cash-flow yield equities, according to Goldman Sachs data.

Raffaele Savi, a portfolio manager for BlackRock Inc's $647 million Global Long/Short Equity Fund , said strong revenue growth is ""more rare than at many points in the past,"" given U.S. gross domestic product growth averaging around 2 percent annually. The fund's recent performance commentary said investors have been shunning company fundamentals.

With the Fed's interest-rate hiking cycle taking hold, investors are bracing for market dynamics to change.

""When you see these huge headlines on big investors and hedge funds throwing in the towel because they can't make sense of the market, that is a sign that things are about to turn,"" said Guggenheim Partners LLC global chief investment officer Scott Minerd.

Part of the reason quality does not work as well as it once did may be that more assets follow ""quantitative"" funds that rely on the same statistics measuring quality, said Brian Hayes, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co LLC .

Plus, it's harder for investors to assess what an earnings report is saying. Technology giants, for instance, derive more of their worth these days from services, patents and brand value, intangibles that can be hard to value.

18,"The immigration debate often boils down to your belief system: either you believe that the Trump administration is abusing the human rights of people crossing the Mexican border or you believe the sanctity of the border outweighs the needs of unauthorized immigrants.

The economics are more cut and dried. Texas businesspeople, economists and common sense all agree: choking off the flow of immigrants across the Rio Grande will choke off economic growth in the state and, eventually, the nation.

The Trump administration has succeeded in discouraging immigration. The number of immigrants who entered the U.S. in 2018 was the fewest in a decade, The New York Times reported recently.

You don't need a degree from the London School of Economics to know that almost every roofer and framer responsible for the heavy lifting in the North Texas building boom of the last decade was an immigrant. You don't need to be an agronomist to know that pretty much every watermelon you buy in Central Market was harvested by a migrant laborer.

""Whether it is the landscaping guy, the busboy at your local restaurant, or the guy cleaning the turn-belts and brushes at your local car wash, the fact is that the vast majority of work done by illegal immigrants is work that most Americans won't do and view as beneath them,"" wrote Oliver Pursche, a money manager and German immigrant, in a book called Immigrants: Unleashing the Economic Force at Our Door.

Ask a farmer or a landscaper in this area why they don't hire some local-born Texans for these kinds of jobs, and see how long they can keep a straight face.

""I have called it quits in regard to finding labor,"" said Stan Miklis, a farmer who owns Caliper Farm-to-Market in Northeast Texas.

""I now farm at a slower pace doing only what my worn-out body will allow.""

Miklis used to hire authorized Latino immigrants and refugees from the Middle East. But the crackdown on immigrants caused a shortage of labor, which, in turn, drove wage payments up out of his budget.

""I believe that the American food, lawn and restaurant price is/was subsidized off the sweat of immigrant labor,"" Miklis said. ""And the beneficiaries never realized it.""

North Texans are among the biggest beneficiaries from this sweat subsidy. People have flocked to this region because a high standard of living comes at a relatively low cost. But middle-class Texans may not always be able to afford a maid, a lawn guy and a regular breakfast taco.

I spoke to one landscaper in North Texas who did not wish to be named. He employed a group of about seven Mexican-born laborers for 10 years. He periodically paid immigration lawyers to have their paperwork renewed — an expensive, but viable proposition. In 2017, the landscaper's crew returned to Mexico, as usual, but the lawyers could not get them back in. After some pricey back-and-forth with immigration authorities, the landscaper was told that his crew had renewed their visas too many times. His only option was to find another group of laborers to sponsor. ""I don't want other guys,"" he told the immigration official. ""I want my guys.""

The landscaper has not been able to find replacements for his crew, forcing him to turn down big jobs. He has postponed retirement plans and, like Miklis, has to take on more of the manual labor himself, just at an age when he should be taking it easier.

And then there's the construction industry. Let the Texan homeowner or tenant who has never benefited from cheap immigrant labor cast the first brick on this subject.

Ever wonder why you get ""more house for your dollar"" in this part of the country? One factor is that many of the workers in the construction industry are unauthorized. Goldman Sachs data shows that immigrants in the construction industry earn significantly less per hour than native-born Americans doing the same work.

Harold Trinh Moore is the owner of JH Moore Inc., a mortgage broker in Fort Worth. Beginning four years ago, Moore said, a dire shortage of home-building labor developed, primarily because of the immigration crackdown.

""I spoke to some of the crews and they are telling me that they are worried because friends and families have been unlawfully picked up,"" said Moore, referring to raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on building sites and elsewhere. ""That has caused a little bit of a mentality to not stay at a job site for too long.""

Workers are now constantly on the move, Moore said, making it impossible to build houses in the sub-$300,000 range in a timely fashion.

The reduction in output by Miklis, the landscaper and the builders is a microcosm of what's happening across Texas and what could happen in all of the U.S. It reflects a simple economic law about increasing national income or gross domestic product.

""Long-term sustainable economic growth in any nation is linked to a growing and appropriately skilled labor force,"" as strategists in brokerage Goldman Sachs Group put it in an August report titled ""Immigration and the U.S. workforce.""

In other words, population growth = economic growth. (Up to a point — Malthusian economists warn that there is such a thing as over-population, but the massive, generally fertile state of Texas is a long way from that point.)

A growing labor force means more consumers buying more goods and services and more taxpayers, the Goldman strategists say.

How did the U.S. grow from a lowly colony to the world's biggest economy in less than 200 years? Beginning in 1776, the U.S. population was ""constantly replenished by immigration from other countries,"" according to Thomas Piketty, the French economist. This constant renewal of the work force meant that the feudal society from the Old World, where social immobility suppressed enterprise, could not be replicated in the U.S.

At the core of Piketty's influential work, Capital, is another question: what went so right in the years 1945 to 1975? Dubbed the ""glorious thirty"" in France, this was the era when developed nations saw wealth spread from the upper classes to create a vast new middle class. Here again, population growth sparked social mobility.

""Strong demographic growth tends to play an equalizing role because it decreases the importance of inherited wealth,"" writes Piketty.

The U.S. is still growing faster and spreading the wealth better than the Old World, and immigration is playing a role. Between 1996 and 2018, immigrants accounted for roughly half the labor-force growth in the U.S., according to Goldman.

""With a decreasing birth rate and an aging native population,"" the U.S. economy will rely on immigrants to an even greater extent in the coming years, if growth is to be sustained, the Goldman strategists said.

The final reason the U.S. should not be cutting off the flow of immigrants is the ""dependency ratio.""

""The percentage of population that is below age 18 and above age 65 — in other words kids and retirees — compared to the percentage of population between those ages, i.e. of working age,"" is shrinking, said Pursche, the German immigrant and money manager. ""So we need, as a country, more working people, and, since our birth rate isn't sufficient, that means immigration.""

For the last three decades the number of people paying into Social Security has been declining when compared with the number of people drawing on it, Pursche said.

The next immigration crisis in the U.S. could be a shortage of immigrants. There has never been an open border between the U.S. and Mexico in the modern era, but Texas and the nation have fared best when the border is porous.

19,"In the Pacific island of Fiji, which adopted the right in 2013, the law has yet to be used in courts, perhaps because people – particularly politically marginalised groups – are still unaware of their rights or can't afford the expensive legal process, says Kiji Vukikomoala, a lawyer who coordinates Fiji's Environmental Law Association. But her organisation has seen a recent surge of interest from communities looking to take such matters to court, she says. ""As the impacts increase... I think it will result in a lot more of our citizens thinking deeply about challenging a lot of these issues and the lack of implementation or enforcement by government.""

Refining the right

So far, the right has probably had the most impact in Latin America and other countries of the Global South, including India and the Philippines, where courts have tended to be more proactive than governments in redressing environmental damage, Rodríguez-Garavito says.

Europe, on the other hand, has been slower off the mark. In the handful of European countries that have embraced the concept, it seems to be less impactful in courts, perhaps because their environmental policies are generally stronger, says Laurence Gay, a human rights law expert of the French National Center for Scientific Research at Aix-Marseille University.

In Slovenia, for instance – a country with abundant greenery and extensive recycling programs – the right may have influenced some of the country’s environmental policies. But its main effect has been shaping the country's mentality towards nature, as evidenced by its education system, which includes extensive curricula on sustainability, says ambassador Sabina Stadler Repnik, permanent representative to the UN in Geneva. ""The educational part of this right, I think, is more important [and where] we can achieve more in the longer term than just going to courts and litigating for years and years.""

And in some European countries when such rights were first adopted, many judges initially debated whether constitutional environmental rights were mere political manifestos, Gay says. But increasingly, ""judges in more and more countries tend to reject such positions and to recognise the binding effects [of the right]""."
20,"Forests in the eastern United States have undergone a radical transformation since the time before European colonization, a new study suggests.

By comparing modern forest composition throughout nine states, across a region from Maine to Pennsylvania, with land-survey records that describe those forests during pre-colonial times, researchers from the Smithsonian Institution found that while the species and variety of trees are mostly same, their distribution and numbers are very different from 400 years ago.

""The modern forest is compositionally distinct from the pre-colonial condition,"" scientists write in a paper published on Wednesday, Sept. 4 in the journal PLOS One.

Most of that change is the result of intensive logging and agricultural clearing that began around 1650 and continued for the next two centuries. These cleared areas then naturally reforested as trees moved back in.

Additionally, researchers found that modern forests are more homogeneous and their composition isn't as affected by local environmental factors, like precipitation, temperature, and elevation. Despite geographic distance, the forest composition between ""any two towns, on average, is slightly more similar in the modern era than it was in the colonial period,"" according to the study.

The graphic below shows how forest composition has changed over the last four centuries. Beech, oak, hemlock, and spruce are much less abundant today, while fir, cherry, and maple trees have increased since pre-colonial times. American chestnut trees were almost completely wiped out in the early 20th century due to an invasive fungal blight that persists today.

You can see how different the forests are:

PLOS One

Across the region, beech trees — large deciduous trees distinguished by smooth, grey bark — experienced the largest decline in abundance, dropping from an average of 22% in pre-colonial times to 7% today. The most noticeable changes are in Vermont, western Massachusetts, and northern Pennsylvania. Beech abundance remained the same in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, according to the study.

PLOS One

Oak trees underwent substantial declines in abundance, from 18% in the pre-colonial era to 11% in modern forests. Oak declines were most pronounced in central Massachusetts and southwestern Pennsylvania.

PLOS One

Hemlock trees declined from 11% in pre-colonial times to 7% in modern times.

PLOS One

Maples experienced the biggest absolute change in relative abundance and now dominate the northeastern U.S., increasing throughout the region from an average of 11% in the past to 31% today.

We cautiously ascend the staircase, the pitch black of the boarded-up house pierced only by my companion’s tiny circle of light. At the top of the landing, the flashlight beam dances in a corner as Quafin, who offered only her first name, points out the furnace. She is giddy; this house—unlike most of the other bank-owned buildings on the block—isn’t completely uninhabitable.

It had been vacated, sealed and winterized in June 2010, according to a notice on the wall posted by BAC Field Services Corporation, a division of Bank of America. It warned: “entry by unauthorized persons is strictly prohibited.” But Bank of America has clearly forgotten about the house and its requirement to provide the “maintenance and security” that would ensure the property could soon be reoccupied. The basement door is ajar, the plumbing has been torn out of the walls and the carpet is stained with water. The last family to live here bought the home for $175,000 in 2002; eight years later, the bank claimed an improbable $286,100 in past-due balances and repossessed it.

It’s May 2012 and we’re in Woodlawn, a largely African American neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. The crew Quafin is a part of dubbed themselves the HIT Squad, short for Housing Identification and Target. Their goal is to map blighted, bank-owned homes with overdue property taxes and neighbors angry enough about the destruction of their neighborhood to consider supporting a plan to repossess on the repossessors.

“Anything I can do,” one woman tells the group after being briefed on its plan to rehab bank-owned homes and move in families without houses. She points across the street to a sagging, boarded-up place adorned with a worn banner—“Grandma’s House Child Care: Register Now!”—and a disconnected number. There are twenty banked-owned homes like it in a five-block radius. Records showed that at least five of them were years past due on their property taxes.

Where exterior walls once were, some houses sport charred holes from fires lit by people trying to stay warm. In 2011, two Chicago firefighters died trying to extinguish such a fire at a vacant foreclosed building. Now, houses across the South Side are pockmarked with red Xs, indicating places the fire department believes to be structurally unsound. In other states—Wisconsin, Minnesota and New York, to name recent examples—foreclosed houses have taken to exploding after bank contractors forgot to turn off the gas.

Most of the occupied homes in the neighborhood we’re visiting display small signs: “Don’t shoot,” they read in lettering superimposed on a child’s face, “I want to grow up.” On the bank-owned houses, such signs have been replaced by heavy-duty steel window guards. (“We work with all types of servicers, receivers, property management and bank asset managers, enabling you to quickly and easily secure your building so you can move on,” boasts Door and Window Guard Systems, a leading company in the burgeoning “building security industry.”)

The dangerous houses are the ones left unsecured, littered with trash and empty Cobra vodka bottles. We approach one that reeks of rancid tuna fish and attempt to push open the basement door, held closed only by a flimsy wire. The next-door neighbor, returning home, asks: “Did you know they killed someone in that backyard just this morning?”

The Equivalent of the Population of Michigan Foreclosed

Since 2007, the foreclosure crisis has displaced at least 10 million people from more than 4 million homes across the country. Families have been evicted from colonials and bungalows, A-frames and two-family brownstones, trailers and ranches, apartment buildings and the prefabricated cookie-cutters that sprang up after World War II. The displaced are young and old, rich and poor, and of every race, ethnicity and religion. They add up to approximately the entire population of Michigan.

However, African-American neighborhoods were targeted more aggressively than others for the sort of predatory loans that led to mass evictions after the economic meltdown of 2007-2008. At the height of the rapacious lending boom, nearly 50 percent of all loans given to African-American families were deemed “subprime.” The New York Times described these contracts as “a financial time-bomb.”

Over the last year and a half, I traveled through many of these neighborhoods, reporting on the grassroots movements of resistance to foreclosure and displacement that have been springing up in the wake of the explosion. These community efforts have proven creative, inspiring and often effective—but in too many cities and towns, the landscape that forms the backdrop to such a movement of hope is one of almost overwhelming destruction. Lots filled with “Cheap Bank-Owned!” trailers line highways. Cities hire contractors dubbed “Blackwater Bailiffs” to keep pace with the dizzying eviction rate.

In recent years, the foreclosure crisis has been turning many African-American communities into conflict zones, torn between a market hell-bent on commodifying life itself and communities organizing to protect their neighborhoods. The more I ventured into such areas, the more I came to realize that the clash of values going on isn’t just theoretical or metaphorical.

“Internal displacement causes conflict,” explained J.R. Fleming, the chairman of the Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign. “And there’s no other country in the world that would force so much internal displacement and pretend that it’s something else.”

Evictions at Gunpoint

It was three in the morning when at least a dozen police cruisers pulled up to the single-story, green-shuttered house in the African-American Atlanta suburb where Christine Frazer and her family lived. The precise number of sheriffs and deputies who arrived is disputed; the local radio station reported twenty-five, while Frazer recalled seeing between forty and fifty.

A locksmith drilled off the home’s locks and dozens of officers burst into the house with flashlights and handguns.

“Who’s in the house?” they shouted. Aside from Frazer, a widow with a vocal devotion to the Man Above, there were three other residents: her 85-year-old mother, her adult daughter and her 4-year-old grandson. Things began to happen fast. Animal control rounded up the pets. Officers told the women to get dressed. Could she take a shower? Frazer asked. Imagine there’s a fire in your house, the officer replied.

“They came to my home like I was a drug dealer,” she told reporters later. Over the next seven hours, the officers hauled out the entire contents of her home and cordoned off the street to prevent friends from helping her retrieve her things.

“I have no idea where some of my jewelry is, stuff I bought when I was 30 years old,” said Frazer. “I am sixty-three. They just threw everything everywhere, helter-skelter on the front lawn in the dark.”

The eviction-turned-raid sparked controversy across Atlanta when it occurred in the spring of 2012, in part because Frazer had a motion pending in federal court that should have stayed the eviction, and in part because she was an active participant of Occupy Homes Atlanta. But this type of militarized reaction is often the outcome when communities—especially those of color—organize to resist eviction.

When Nicole Shelton attempted to move back into her repossessed home in a picket-fence subdivision in North Carolina, the Raleigh police department sent in more than a dozen police officers and an eight-person SWAT team. Officers were equipped with M5 submachine guns. A helicopter roared overhead. In Boston, one organizer with the community group City Life/Vida Urbana remembers the police acting so aggressively at an eviction blockade in a Haitian neighborhood that the grandmother of the family had a heart attack right in the driveway.

And sometimes it doesn’t require resistance at all. On the South Side of Chicago, explained Toussaint Losier, a community organizer completing his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, “They bust in the door, and it’s at the point of a gun that you get evicted.”

Exiles in America

There have been widespread foreclosures—and some organized resistance—in predominately white communities, too. Kevin Kirkman, captain of the civil division of the Lee County sheriff’s office, explained, “I get so many [eviction] papers in here, it’s unbelievable.”

More than 75 percent of the residents in North Carolina’s Lee County are whites. But Kirkman still sees the ripple effects of mass foreclosure here. “You’re talking about a mudslide where a lot of things are affected. You’re talking about taxes, about retail sales if people move, about food services, about gasoline. You see what I’m talking about? When you lose a family in the community? Some people leave the community. I have seen people leave the state of North Carolina.”

He added, “I’m going be honest with you, my feeling is that I would not do these evictions.”

Still, the difficulties white America has faced during the foreclosure crisis don’t compare with what Wall Street and the banks have inflicted, physically and psychologically, on African-American neighborhoods. As countless leaked documents, insider dispositions and Department of Justice filings demonstrate, those neighborhoods were systematically and illegally targeted for the worst of the worst mortgages. As one former Wells Fargo mortgage broker explained in a sworn affidavit, “The company put ‘bounties’ on minority borrowers. By this I mean that loan officers received cash incentives to aggressively market subprime loans in minority communities.”

This pushing of predatory loans was all the more insidious because these same communities had been starved of mortgages for decades as a result of the Federal Housing Authority’s refusal to guarantee loans in communities of color. As Mike Fannon, development associate for the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, explained, “The same banks that denied capital now injected too much toxic capital and decimated the local economy.”

The effect, according to a 2012 National Fair Housing Alliance report, has been “the largest loss of wealth for these communities in modern history.” Between 2009 and 2012 African Americans lost just under $200 billion in wealth, bringing the gap between white and black wealth to a staggering 20:1 ratio.

There is also a longer trajectory of racial exclusion at play here, a history that makes the foreclosure crisis yet another chapter in an epic and enduring quest for home. From enslavement to sharecropping, redlining to restrictive covenants, the United States has too often been an inhospitable land for people of color. Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King echoed W.E.B. Dubois in declaring that the African American still “finds himself in exile in his own land.” Today, it’s hard not to see that reality painted across the 2010 census data, where the maps measuring the concentration of vacant houses and the maps measuring the concentration of African Americans, while not exactly the same, are uncomfortably close to a match.

As Ben Austen wrote in the New York Times Magazine, “The US Postal Service, which tracks these numbers, reported that 62,000 properties in Chicago were vacant at the end of last year, with two-thirds of them clustered as if to form a sinkhole in just a few black neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.” The same phenomenon holds true in cities across the country. And once a house is empty in such neighborhoods, all too often, no one is moving back in.

Crime Starts at the Top

“There were feces in the basement, urine, rolled-up carpet,” said Thomas Turner, a housing activist in Chicago describing the inside of a foreclosed home, once owned, according to neighbors, by an 80-year-old man. Under the ownership of the Pittsburgh-based bank PNC, Turner explained, “It was abandoned for six years, so squatters and strippers had punched holes in the walls. There was no toilet, no tub, all the kitchen cabinets were torn out. The bedroom looked like someone had taken a sledgehammer and just started swinging… I still see gang members on the front porch or rolling up real slow in the car.”

Another Chicago resident, Erica Johnson, described a vacant home similarly. “There were clothes, books, broken dressers, little white drug bags, used condoms,” she said. “It was a little drug house, and they were probably bringing their girls up in here.”

Some foreclosed homes become brothels, such as a Deutsche Bank-owned house in South Los Angeles where the girls’ names and prices were scrawled in blue marker across the upstairs walls. Others become meth labs or gang hideouts.

These bank-owned vacant houses help spread crime and poverty in already distressed communities—a reality that became obvious to me when I accompanied Dorian Morris, a certified building inspector, on one of his surveys of the vacant homes on the north side of Minneapolis. Signs on nearly every home advertised the severity of the housing crisis in this area: neon green “no trespassing” stickers on boarded-up foreclosed homes and red “stand together, stop foreclosure” posters on places supporting Occupy Homes Minneapolis. On more than a dozen lots, the only indication that a family once lived there was a skinny red metal rod marking the spot where a razed house once stood.

As in other hard-hit African-American neighborhoods across the country, residents here had organized to stop bank-pursued evictions from stripping the value from the community. Neighborhood support had, for instance, helped a mother named Monique White beat her eviction in a highly publicized six-month battle against US Bank only weeks before I arrived. Still, the never-ending evictions were eating away at the stability of the neighborhood.

“That’s a known crack house,” said Morris, as he pointed at a brick structure less than 100 meters away from a neighborhood park. More than half the homes within sight were boarded up with plywood. Within five minutes, we had passed two former residences he identified as current drug houses and a handful more that he said had already been raided by the police—all foreclosed homes where families used to live.

As we drove, we discussed the illegal chain of events that transformed these homes into drug dens. The crimes started at the top. Banks peddled toxic mortgages like crack, paying employees cash incentives to push them in African-American neighborhoods. The loans exploded, so they forged millions of foreclosure affidavits to speed state-enforced evictions.

Once homes are vacant, bank contractors insufficiently seal and maintain them, allowing intruders to strip the houses of their copper wiring, plumbing and sometimes even the furnace. The copper alone sells for anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar per pound. Finally, people dealing drugs begin to use the houses at night as distribution centers. The street-level crime drags down neighboring property values, spurring more foreclosures and evictions. And so the cycle continues.

Banks are legally obligated to maintain and market their foreclosed properties, but they often shirk those responsibilities—especially in communities of color. In an investigation of more than 1,000 homes across the country, the National Fair Housing Alliance found that bank-owned homes in communities of color were more likely than homes in white neighborhoods to have graffiti and peeling paint on the exterior, trash and dead leaves strewn across the sidewalk, unsecured locks on the doors and be missing “for sale” signs on their front lawns.

Foreclosed houses in such neighborhoods were also 80 percent more likely to have a broken or boarded-up window, and 30 percent more likely to have trash on the front lawn. After a lawsuit, Wells Fargo paid $42 million to settle charges of racially discriminatory maintenance; there’s scant evidence to suggest the practice has changed since. Cities have increased fines levied against banks that don’t maintain their houses, but not a single bank has been held accountable for drug dealing, murders and rapes that occur on their unmaintained or poorly maintained properties. The only “crime” they appear concerned about is when community activists try to fix up such homes and move families in—doing the job the bank was supposed to do in the first place. Then banks call the police to arrest the “trespassers.”

Sacrifice Zones

The double standards in property maintenance lead to an “extremely troubling” trend in home sales: these uninviting neglected houses, disproportionately located in communities of color, are most often being snapped up by investors rather than families. Overwhelmingly, the investor of choice is the Blackstone Group, one of the world’s largest private equity firms and now the nation’s largest owner of single-family homes. Since April 2012, Blackstone has spent more than $4.5 billion buying at least 30,000 houses concentrated in cities hard-hit by foreclosure, including Atlanta, Jacksonville, Orlando, Chicago, Charlotte, Phoenix and urban areas across California. According to local real estate brokers, the company often makes its purchases in cash.

The idea is that there’s big money to be made in rental properties these days, given that there are millions of displaced, former homeowners with wrecked credit scores looking for places to stay. It’s like a pay-to-play game of musical chairs—except Wall Street owns the stereo, the speakers, the chairs and the roof, and somehow when the music stops you’re always out.

Vacant houses, whether owned by banks or Blackstone, create foreclosure spirals, each vacant house dragging down the property values of neighbors, which, in turn, decreases a city’s property tax revenue and the capacity of local government to provide essential services. Shuttered schools in Philadelphia and Chicago. Closed hospitals in Cleveland. Slashed senior programs in Baltimore. All of these essential services, eliminated far more often in communities of color, are the collateral damage of the foreclosure crisis.

A 2011 report by the US Government Accountability Office, submitted to the House Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, cited nearly a dozen examples of how such declines in tax revenues caused by vacancies have led cities to cut funding for public works, libraries, parks, recreation programs and school districts. One city even cut a program intended to address vacant foreclosed properties, thanks to a tax revenue shortfall.

The final dystopian outcome of this spiral is what journalist Naomi Klein famously termed the shock doctrine: a crisis is pushed so far that it finally justifies dramatic outside intervention (read: privatization). It’s the type of outcome we’re currently seeing in Michigan, where, according to a court ruling last week, “Detroit’s recent bankruptcy filing only emphasizes the broader consequences of predatory lending and the foreclosures that inevitably result.” That city may be undergoing the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, but unlike when the big banks and giant financial outfits teetered at the edge of collapse, President Obama has made it clear that this time there will be no billion-dollar federal bailout.

“With the mass displacement, it ends up being a situation where people are just like, ‘Well, we’ll just have to bulldoze those homes,’” Chicago organizer Toussaint Losier told me. “They become sacrifice zones rather than places where people bring imaginative solutions.”

The Shield and the Sword

Small groups of community organizers are shouldering the Herculean task of protecting such neighborhoods abandoned by the federal government.

“Look, if you want to take our home, it’s an act of war,” explains Losier, so his group’s response is, metaphorically, “the sword and the shield.” It’s a strategy he learned from the Boston anti-foreclosure group City Life/Vida Urbana. The shield represents the exceedingly modest legal protection afforded to people under a judicial system that assigns more rights to the banks than them—and allows no-guilt settlements for the powerful caught flagrantly breaking the law. (In the case of foreclosure crimes, see for example the $335 million Bank of America discrimination settlement in 2011, the $26 billion robo-signing settlement in 2012 and the $8.5 billion settlement over wrongful foreclosures in 2013.)

The sword represents actions—from petitions to eviction blockades—aimed at stopping evictions and repairing neighborhoods. And yes, there is a life-size, fabricated sword-and-shield set at the City Life office in Boston. First-time attendees of the group’s weekly meetings must hoist the sword over their heads and assert that they are willing to fight for their homes. “Then we will fight with you!” the rest of the group cheers.

Across the country, communities of color deploy these two strategies, and a third that could be called “the paintbrush”: creative tactics aimed at building something new amid the devastation. In Detroit and Philadelphia, neighborhoods are seeding community gardens in hundreds of vacant lots. In Boston, one set of community activists cleaned up their block and dumped the trash—gathered from the front lawn of a foreclosed Bank of America-owned home—on the doorstep of the regional bank president’s brownstone.

In Minnesota and California, grassroots political organizing pressured state legislatures to adopt the nation’s first two homeowner bills of rights. A Barclays report later complained that “servicers have become significantly more cautious when carrying out foreclosure sales” as a result of the legislation. In Chicago, home liberation groups are rehabbing and occupying vacant properties, while anti-violence groups are intervening in the conflicts caused by poverty and mass displacement.

Both of the foreclosed Chicago houses that Thomas Turner and Erica Johnson described as being filled with feces, used condoms and drugs are now clean, painted and occupied. Turner even stenciled small purple birds on the walls of the one he worked on. But the continued scale of the crisis—forgotten by a media more interested in rising home values than eviction notices—requires more than community rehab and tepid financial regulation. It demands that we question, and reimagine, a system of property ownership that has prevented large segments of the population from making real decisions about the communities in which they live. And in case you’re thinking that this is a problem only for Black America, think again. As The New York Times warned in April, “The alchemists of Wall Street are at it again…reviving the same types of investments that many thought were gone for good.”

The question is whether, this time around, we’ll see their potion for what it is: poison that threatens to turn each of us, as W.E.B. Dubois wrote, into “an outcast and a stranger in my own house.”

What do the cases of Edward Snowden and Robert Seldon Lady have in common?"

Farmers and producers are coming together to share resources​ and maintain strict health standards, as well as looking to the government​ for help. We look at some of the positive initiatives that have emerged in the midst of the pandemic.

Danone offers $1.5m

Danone North America is one of the largest, mainstream dairy companies in the continent, with a wide brand portfolio of milk, yogurt, ice cream, dairy alternatives and more.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak has escalated into a global pandemic, many CPG brands have stepped up with food and cash donations to local communities. Danone NA is giving $1.2m to the cause, with an additional $300,000 worth of product donations.

The money will be used to purchase and deliver fresh and non-perishable food, pick up and distribute unused food from businesses or workplaces and mobilize volunteers. A portion of the money will support the New York-based City Harvest and Feeding Westchester organizations, and the Colorado-based Community Food Share and We Don’t Waste.

Danone NA has headquarter offices and large employee populations in these two states, and the money will also assist in communities in California, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia.

Mariano Lozano, CEO of Danone NA, said in a statement posted to LinkedIn, “In times like this, the resilience of the human spirit is more visible than ever. It’s incredibly uplifting to see so many businesses and individuals stepping up to support employees, customers and communities.​

“As a food and beverage company – one of our nation’s critical infrastructure industries – we’ve always believed we have an important responsibility to use our business as a force for good.”​

Supplying food banks

The company has already donated $20,000 to a rapid response fund that will be used to provide emergency food services in Colorado. And they currently donate more than 1,000 gallons of Horizon Organic milk weekly to help Community Food Share serve local residents.

Kim Ruotsala, executive director of Community Food Share, said, “We are seeing a sharp increase in local need for food during this crisis. Last week when the schools closed statewide, we had our single highest distribution day ever at our ​[Colorado] facility, including many individuals and families who were visiting the food bank for the first time.”​

Last week Danone NA donated approximately 50,000 cups of yogurt from its Activia, Two Good, Dannon, Oikos, and Light + Fit brands, and 56,000 Horizon Organic milk boxes to Feeding Westchester to support residents in New Rochelle, New York.

Judy Campisi, senior director of development for Feeding Westchester, said, “For many children across Westchester, no school means no food. With districts closed across the County, Feeding Westchester has led the charge to make sure students who rely on free or reduced breakfast and lunch still have access to good, nutritious food.”​

Chobani helps at home

Greek yogurt company Chobani has also announced several charitable initiatives in the wake of the coronavirus. They first donated more than 35,000 Chobani products to the hard-hit New Rochelle community in their home state of New York.

Through a partnership with the governor, Feeding America Westchester and the New York National Guard, Chobani distributed yogurt, oat beverages and dairy creamers to those in the containment area, and particularly those who count on the school system to feed their kids.

“New York is our home and now is the time for business to step and do what we can to help and support our neighbors,”​ said Peter McGuinness, president at Chobani.

With manufacturing plants in Twin Falls, Idaho and South Edmeston, New York, Chobani has coordinated much of its efforts in these areas. The company told DairyReporter that in Central New York they have donated time, money and products to the Unadilla Valley School District and the Roots & Wings Food Pantry.

Chobani has also donated to the Boards of Cooperative Educational Services and the Chenango County Health Department. And in Norwich, New York, Chobani has assisted the school district, the police department and the Rehabilitation & Nursing Center.

In Idaho, Chobani is helping out the Twin Falls School District Food Pantries, Boys & Girls Club locations, Meals on Wheels and the Twin Falls Senior Center, the Valley House At-Risk Homeless Shelter, Heritage Academy, the South Central District Health Department, and the Riverside Hotel and Interfaith Shelter in Boise.

“It’s all about community, especially in times like this,”​ McGuinness said."
26,"On August 26, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced two rule changes to further refine and incentivize whistleblowing through their highly successful whistleblower program. The proposed changes were first introduced in February 2022.

First, the SEC modified Rule 21F-3(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which addresses related action payments. The Commission is now able to pay whistleblowers for assistance in connection with non-SEC actions in additional circumstances, including cases in which the other agency’s whistleblower program has the more direct or relevant connection to the related action.

After receiving and reviewing dozens of public comments in regard to this rule, the SEC adopted the “comparability approach” to its Multiple-Recovery Rule, which weighs one program against the SEC’s to determine the source of payment.

Whistleblowers are now incentivized to share their information with any agency that comes forward, no matter their size or financial resources. This ensures a payout in successful related actions stemming from these agencies that may have a weak, underfunded, or inexistent whistleblower program.

In its second rule amendment, the SEC added subsection (d) to Exchange Act Rule 21F-6. The new Rule 21F-6(d) affirmed the Commission’s authority to consider award amounts only in the instance of increasing that award. The Commission does not have the same discretion when it comes to decreasing an award.

According to the SEC’s Final Rule, this ensures that “potentially large awards are not decreased because of their size,” as “large awards directly [advance] the purpose of the whistleblower program (and by extension the interests of the investing public) by incentivizing whistleblowers to report violations [of the securities laws] to the Commission.”

Stephen M. Kohn, partner of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto and Chairman of the Board of the National Whistleblower Center, believes that this provision is key in getting top executives and employees to come forward.

“The Commission ensured that whistleblowers who turn in the biggest frauds will not be penalized by having their rewards reduced,” Kohn said. “As the Commission understood, paying large awards in the biggest fraud cases will have a deterrent effect on Wall Street.”

The following changes will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. These rules will apply to any whistleblower award application that is pending with the Commission as of that date, as well as to all future-filed award applications.

27,"When investors think about sustainable investing, they often focus on broad themes—such as water scarcity or clean energy—or individual companies that are leaders in environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.

But those looking to build their ESG portfolios could also tap into municipal bonds. Increasingly issued by state and local governments to fund public projects that can have a positive social or environmental impact—from schools in underserved areas to infrastructure for zero-emission transportation—muni bonds can clearly align with sustainability goals.

What makes them potentially alluring right now? New analysis from Morgan Stanley Research finds that muni bond valuations are still driven largely by the issuer’s credit rating, and not according to their ability to address ESG-related risks—a pricing advantage that may soon change.

“Right now, investors interested in building a more sustainable bond portfolio can do so without paying a premium,” says Samantha Favis, a strategist on the Municipal Fixed-Income team at Morgan Stanley Research.

“Looking ahead,” says Favis, “we think ESG factors could begin to impact bond performance as the connection between credit risk and environmental and social variables becomes harder to ignore.”

This pie chart shows how states allocate investors’ capital. By financing the construction, maintenance, and improvement of critical public infrastructure and community development, municipal investing largely overlaps with sustainability goals."
28,"Saudi banking, ‘a cornerstone for the region, ought to eye global expansion’

LONDON: The Saudi banking system has become a cornerstone for the industry in the region but the Kingdom needs to focus more on global expansion, according to an industry expert.

The country has undergone a process of modernization at a very rapid pace, which “is a good thing,” George Kanaan, the CEO of the London-based Arab Bankers Association, told Arab News, and having a coherent vision to work within is very important.

“You really cannot run a country, or create progress in a country, without having a vision as to where you want to see that country be, and the need for reforms is great,” he said.

Kanaan, a Harvard graduate who has worked in New York, Athens, Saudi Arabia and Chicago, said the Kingdom’s banking system is continually growing in sophistication and becoming more reliant on local talent, but there is still a lot of potential for growth, particularly in the international arena.

“The Saudi banking system, given what Saudi Arabia is all about, needs to become more globalized,” he said. “It could become the dominant banking system in the Middle East, generally, given its resources and its expertise right now, but it should go beyond the Middle East.”

The Kingdom should be looking expand its banking presence in Africa, Europe, the US and Asia, “where the growth in the future seems to be,” Kanaan said.

“We don’t see much presence, for example in the UK, (where) we have only two banks from Saudi Arabia, but its vision should be more regional and more global,” he added.

The Kingdom launched 11 initiatives in 2017 to help achieve finance-related aims of Vision 2030, the most prominent of which was the Financial Sector Development Program. This aims to create a diversified and effective financial-services sector to support the development of the national economy, diversify its sources of income, and stimulate savings, finance and investment.

In terms of size, the Saudi banking sector is expected to grow to hold assets worth SR4.553 billion ($1.214 billion) by 2030, compared with SR2.631 billion in 2019, the government has said.

Saudi banking has come a long way since 1926, when the Netherlands Trading Society opened its first branch in Jeddah to provide financial services for pilgrims, who were the major source of revenue in the local economy before the discovery of oil in 1939.

After the Second World War, demand for oil surged. Production, government revenues and expenditure rose rapidly as a result, and foreign banks began to enter the market. By end of 1989, there were 1,007 branches compared with 247 in 1980.

Kanaan, who began his banking career with Citibank in New York in 1975, moved to Riyadh in the late 1970s where he worked as a relationship manager in the bank’s contracting division — which later became the Saudi American Bank and is now Samba.

“Saudi Arabia was being built, contractor financing was greatly in demand and we had innovated greatly in terms of our ability to meet contractors’ needs without taking too much risk, because contracting is known as a risky business,” he said.

“I was asked to form the first merchant-banking unit for the new bank, in the early 1980s, and this work was very important because the projects and work being introduced in the Kingdom were becoming larger and larger and the clients who were taking on these projects were beginning to need very large facilities.”

The clients were not able to do this on their own and so banks in Bahrain, Dubai, Hong Kong and London were all looking for a share of their business.

“The risk was relatively reasonable; the market in Saudi Arabia was huge, everybody wanted to be part of the action and I was the ticket,” Kanaan said.

“I became probably one of the most well-known bankers in Saudi Arabia because of the big deals and syndications being reported upon.”

Saudi banking regulations have become more extensive and sophisticated in the past two decades, particularly since the global financial crisis of 2008, he said, but in his opinion we have reached a point where, in some respects, the regulatory setup needs to ease off and rethink some of its aspects.

“Sustainable investment has become a priority in the global agenda,” Kanaan said. “There has been a rise in investments in environmental, social and corporate governance and related risk policies.

“It has even become a necessity to define and develop corporate-sustainability strategies and it is part of the agenda of global governments.”

The current Saudi strategy aims to strengthen the global position of the Kingdom in Islamic finance, given it has the largest share of this sector, he said.

“The strategy will also contribute to the necessary marketing and incentives to spread the tremendous capabilities that the Kingdom is undertaking in this sector,” said Kanaan.

“The Kingdom possesses adequate financial and intellectual capital to promote this sector locally and market it internationally, and this will allow it to attract more assets and influence in the Islamic finance sector and enhance KSA’s international position as the leader in Islamic finance.

“It’s become quite remarkable. It’s at the forefront of banking practice around the world. Saudi banking is interesting now and the successive efforts at Saudization — bringing Saudis into good positions in the banks — have succeeded, finally, and you are seeing a lot of Saudi bankers, not only Saudi banks full up with all sorts of expatriate talent.

“Saudi banking right now is highly rated and very professional, the banks are very, very strong, and the mergers are going to lead to even stronger and bigger banks.”"

Having long been at loggerheads over trade, technology and capital markets, the world's foremost economic superpowers are turning their attention to climate change as the next path to commercial supremacy. China outspent the U.S. by nearly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investment between 2010 and 2020, according to BNEF data cited by Bank of America's ESG Research team in a report last month. Pressure points including ""supply chain dominance, domestic-focused manufacturing policies, human rights-related laws and carbon-related trade tariffs,"" BofA analysts said. BofA managing director of research Haim Israel said a ""climate war"" between Washington and Beijing would follow the tech war and trade war as climate change becomes the dominant economic and political theme of the coming decades.

""It's not just about saving the planet. We believe climate strategies offer a route to global supremacy, as much more is at stake here: the economic impact of climate could reach $69 trillion this century, and energy transition investment needing to rise up to $4 trillion per year,"" Israel said in a research note in February. ""Energy independence and supply chain control are also at stake with the geopolitical balance of power also linked to peak oil in 2030."" Israel told CNBC that the U.S. would look to ramp up legislation, innovation and capital flows into renewable energies such as wind, solar, batteries and hydrogen. ""We also see a ramp-up in electric cars. Remember that today, give or take, 50% of all oil in the world is allocated to the transportation market, and cars is a big part of it. So whoever will control EVs and EV technology will definitely have a big advantage going forward,"" he added. Tensions between the U.S. and China have continued under President Joe Biden's administration, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducting terse discussions with Chinese delegates in Alaska last month.

Harry Broadman, managing director and chair of the emerging markets and CFIUS practices at Berkeley Research Group, told CNBC last week that developed countries' ability to create, execute and sell products that advance the climate agenda without negatively affecting the labor market would shape the economic landscape in the coming years. ""As long as people believe that there is going to be a market for such technologies and that's going to be dictated by how cheap it is, and whether it destroys jobs or creates jobs — it does not necessarily have to destroy jobs at all — that is going to be the driving imperative, and I think that race is already underway,"" Broadman said. Ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, U.K. in June, Broadman, an assistant U.S. trade representative during the Clinton administration, said the group of major economies will need to drastically evolve their research and development and sovereign-to-sovereign science and technology collaborations in order to compete with China. The 'R&D7' Broadman is pushing for an ""R&D7"" to be included on the G-7 agenda, similar to other working groups across members on issues of global importance. Its aim would be to reform the structure underlying the negotiation and execution of international science and technology agreements among G-7 countries. It would also form a stand-alone body tasked with ensuring that these agreements strengthen and recalibrate R&D collaboration within the G-7. ""We've done really well among democratic countries collaborating on investment and trade, but we've done an extraordinarily poor job in R&D, and this is where China is frankly a huge competitive and potentially a huge economic and maybe geopolitical, threat,"" he said. China has pledged net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. Countries operating net-zero pledges currently account for just under half of all global emissions, with China representing around two-thirds of these, according to a recent equity research report from Goldman Sachs.

LIMA — Anais Olivares was always pretty resourceful. Growing up in Nueva Esperanza, an overcrowded low-income suburb on the outskirts of Lima, she had to be.

Without an internet connection in the house, Olivares did homework by adding five soles (about $1.50) at a time of data to a cellphone and using it as an intermittent — and not very reliable — personal hotspot. Other times she’d use the Wi-Fi connection at her uncle’s, repaying him by fixing up old, broken-down laptops he hoped to resell.

The result was that Olivares spent a lot of time on YouTube learning how to fix old computers, fostering a skill set and an interest that would, ultimately, pay dividends.

“I think I was always looking for a way to get out of that box of being a woman and having to be a señorita,” Olivares told AQ.

Olivares’ mother sacrificed to pay her way into a short-track graphic design program at a technical college. But after graduation, potential employers said she needed to learn several software programs she just wasn’t familiar with. Under pressure to help support her family, Olivares was looking for any kind of steady job when she came across Laboratoria — a nonprofit that trains young women, mostly from disadvantaged backgrounds, in computer programming.

A six-month boot camp at Laboratoria helped Olivares adapt her skills to a demanding job market, and eventually get work as a programmer at a telecommunications firm. Men outnumber women in programming fields in Latin America by nine to one, but Olivares is not alone — and Laboratoria is part of the reason why.

Started in 2014 by Peruvian tech entrepreneur Mariana Costa Checa, the organization’s primary goal is to bridge the tech gender divide, based on the belief that all women — and not just those from elite universities — can thrive in the male-dominated tech industry if given the chance.

“We unleash or find talent in tech (in places that are) otherwise considered unreasonable,” Karen Kelly, Laboratoria’s regional partnerships manager, told AQ.

The emphasis on low-income students is fundamental to Laboratoria’s approach. Enrollees only pay tuition if they get a job within six months of graduat ing, and then do so gradually over two years. The organization lends laptops to students in need and helps them prepare for job interviews and negotiate salaries.

More than 1,600 women like Olivares have graduated from Laboratoria’s boot camps as web developers and user-experience designers. All told, more than 80% of students successfully finish the program, and nearly the same percentage get a job in a relevant field within six months. Some are hired right away by tech companies, banks, startups or multilateral institutions across the region. Laboratoria has won praise from former U.S. President Barack Obama and received funding from Microsoft, Google, BlackRock and USAID. From its base in Peru, the organization has expanded into Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile and now, after going virtual during the pandemic, is doubling down on plans to reach women remotely.

Laboratoria is part of a broader push to support a generation of female programmers in Latin America that is shrugging off gender stereotypes to seize opportunities in some of the region’s fastest-growing fields. When the organization started its coding bootcamps in Peru in 2014, just 7% of web programmers in the country were women, according to a poll by the Peru Mozilla community. Four years later, that figure had risen to 17%. Crucially, programming jobs often pay well even for those workers without university degrees — creating an opportunity for women who may not have had access to higher education.

Fabiola Leon-Velarde, the head of CONCYTEC, a government agency that promotes science and technology in Peru, said policymakers should take note. Latin America suffers from a shortage of nearly half a million IT professionals, according to the International Data Corporation, and women make up a disproportionate share of “ni nis”— young people who are neither studying nor working and who could benefit from alternatives to university education.

“Women offer huge possibilities in tech,” Leon-Velarde told AQ, blaming sexism for limiting their potential. “This is a discipline that we’re going to need so much as digital communication technology takes over.”

More than 1,600 women have finished the Laboratoria program since 2014.

COVID-19 complicates the picture — but may also offer opportunities for women who want to follow in Olivares’ footsteps. Laboratoria’s graduates have had a harder time finding jobs during the current turmoil, but Kelly believes demand for web developers could rise in the future as the pandemic pushes more companies and industries to digitize.

The broader benefits of bridging the tech gender divide are hard to overstate. Providing equal opportunities for programming work will help ensure that women get a fair share of the spoils of the tech boom, but it’s also key to building a digital world with less of a male bias, experts say.

Mariel Quezada, a Laboratoria graduate from Chile, works for an app that lets consumers compare prices for pharmaceuticals. She said her male colleagues tend to overlook how different users might experience a product, leading to tweaks that make it accessible for more people.

“I’m always debating little things like the size of the font,” Quezada told AQ.

Ultimately, Laboratoria’s bootcamp is almost as much about personal transformations as it is about professional ones. Since working in telecommunications and later for a consultancy and a bank, Olivares has passed on new job opportunities to return to Laboratoria as a coach to help future students.

“Laboratoria forms a lot of women who want to change the world — their world and the world around them,” she said. “It might sound ambitious but that’s what it’s about.”

Other Initiatives That Support Women in STEM

By Leonie Rauls Chicas en Tecnología, Argentina Chicas en Tecnología was started by a group of female tech professionals to offer free coding and entrepreneurship programs for girls between the ages of 13 and 17 years old. The students team up to develop applications that address problems in their communities, with female experts in technology and business assisting in the development of the apps and providing inspiration and motivation for the girls. Alumni join #ComunidadCET, a network of mentors and business partners to support them in future projects. In 2019, over 4,100 girls participated in the program developing over 200 apps, including those that improve mobility for people with disabilities, decrease paper consumption in schools, and even help inform their communities about different political parties.

Observatorio STEM, Bolivia Founded in 2018 with support from UNICEF, Observatorio STEM set out to measure the state of science and technology education in Bolivia. The research uncovered opportunities to improve women’s employment and led to the creation of a program where professional women teach programming skills to young mothers. With an entirely female team, Observatorio operates under the motto “working with women for women.” Guely Morató Loredo, the organization’s director, told AQ that “training young mothers in a feminine environment helps break gender stereotypes, and inspires young girls to dedicate themselves to STEM careers.” The program is still in the pilot stage, but Loredo said its reach goes beyond employment for young mothers as it creates role models that will give young girls confidence to pursue careers in STEM fields.

Fellowship program for indigenous women with PhD in STEM, Mexico Coordinated by the federal government’s Center for Investigations and Advanced Studies in Social Anthropology (CIESAS), this program has funded 12 women in the last two years developing post-doctoral projects such as studying the impacts of climate change on indigenous communities, developing more efficient agricultural practices, and researching cancer treatments. Post-doctoral candidates present their projects in a yearly forum, which became a support network for indigenous women working in STEM. CIESAS has several other programs and in the past 20 years, over 200 scholarships were awarded to students from 38 indigenous groups, of which 40% were women.

Programa Valentina, Guatemala Named after Valentina Tereshkova, the first female to travel to space, this 100% women-led and women-run high-impact technology company aims to create economic opportunities for women aside from migrating north. Valentina combines technology skill building such as teaching data analysis and project management trainings with job placement in the technology sector. After taking a personality test to identify participants’ strengths, the women go through a 6-week training program, focused on technological and soft skills. Valentina has certified 660 women since its founding in 2017 and uses an analytics platform to match skill set and job openings. Jessica Hammer, the company’s CEO, told AQ: “Valentina simply helps women see their potential.”

Students are encouraged to experiment, collaborate and take criticism and mistakes in stride. The goal is to teach them the “soft skills” needed to contribute as professionals and leaders, said Kelly. Laboratoria is now using the same techniques to offer classes to companies that want to foster a culture of continuous learning, using revenues from the service to offset its program costs.

“The first month is really, really hard because you have to change your internal chip,” said Lesly Muñoz, a new graduate who turned to Laboratoria after struggling to find a job with her psychology degree. “For so long I’d convinced myself that I couldn’t learn things in tech or engineering, but really I couldn’t learn them only because I thought I couldn’t. That change in mentality is the most important thing about Laboratoria.”

31,"Professor Katy Campbell, University of Alberta, investigates social inclusion through a gendered lens, specifically regarding technology

We have been interested in how gender impacts the design, adoption and use of technology since, at least, the 1970s. We have investigated the experiences of girls and women with learning and working with technology but more recently, we have adopted a broader, gendered perspective.

In the past 10 years or so we have more frequently explored gender issues through an intersectional lens, and even more recently as a problem of social inclusion. An intersectional lens helps us understand inclusion, and exclusion, from multiple dimensions of difference, such as ethnicity, age, sexuality, socioeconomic class, location, and health. For example, the experience in a computer science classroom, or in an engineering company, may be quite different for a middle-class Caucasian woman living in an urban environment than an indigenous woman living in a vulnerable rural environment with limited broadband access.

What is a “gendered perspective”?

Gender is both understood and realised in different ways among different cultures and at different times. In North America, gender and sex have almost become interchangeable, even though “gender” refers to social roles while “sex” refers to biological attributes. This is important from an intersectional point of view, because a “gendered” approach opens up our understanding of the challenges faced by, for example, transgendered learners or workers.

When we first started looking at gender and technology issues, from the 1970’s to the 1990’s, we focused on the design of technologies and tools that reflected a dominant Western culture. In the education sector, we looked at delivery models like distance education; software and game design; access to technology (i.e., the “digital divide”); designing computer labs in primary and secondary schools, and psychological barriers to participation. In other words, we believed that once girls and boys read the same books, were exposed to the same curriculum, taught by the same teacher, and given equal opportunities to practice, any remaining problems were the “fault” of the girl. Reflecting the “cultural deficit” model, we designed interventions to narrow the gaps in access, ability or attitude.

The cultural deficit model stems from negative beliefs and assumptions regarding the ability, aspirations and work ethic of systematically marginalised peoples. For example, once the digital divide problem was resolved, girls and boys would have equal access to the family’s computer. In fact, decades of research have shown us in general that boys have always had more and better access to computers at home, males tend to dominate computer resources in school, male teachers predominate in these settings, and computing spaces, software and games have been designed primarily by males and tend to reflect “masculine” interests. Unfortunate effects of this inequitable situation include lack of self-efficacy in girls and women and fewer women in STEM disciplines and workplaces, perpetuating the problem of poorly designed and exclusionary digital resources, curriculum, and learning and working spaces and policies. If race, location, age or religious beliefs are included and intersect with sex, the problem becomes much more complicated.

The digital divide

An intersectional approach gives us more tools to understand and, hopefully, resolve the digital divide challenge of the 2020’s that acknowledges that equitable access is more than technological. The World Bank defines “social inclusion” as “the process of improving the terms on which individuals and groups take part in society – improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of those disadvantaged because of their identity.” Exclusion on the basis of social identity may involve discriminating or stigmatising attitudes, beliefs, or values, and also on the basis of legal systems, land, and labour markets. Social exclusion robs individuals of dignity, security, and opportunity, and happens across dimensions of gender, age, location, occupation, race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship status, disability, and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), among other factors.

Likewise, UNESCO’s vision of an inclusive society as a “society for all”, in which every individual enjoys active participation, was reiterated in the Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, “to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” In the document Education 2030 (2016) that emerged from this declaration, over 1600 participants from 160 countries concluded “inclusion and equity through education is the cornerstone of a transformative education agenda, and we therefore commit to addressing all forms of exclusion and marginalisation, disparities and inequalities in access, participation and learning outcomes…recognise the importance of gender equality in achieving the right to education for all”, and are “committed to supporting gender-sensitive policies, planning and learning environments; mainstreaming gender issues in teacher training and curricula; and eliminating gender-based discrimination and violence in schools” (p.7).

A commitment to lifelong learning opportunities for all includes equitable and increased access to “quality technical and vocational education and training and higher education and research…the provision of flexible learning pathways…ensuring that all youth and adults, especially girls and women…are provided with adult learning, education and training opportunities” (p.7). Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are emphasised as strengthening education systems, knowledge dissemination, information access, quality and effective learning, and more effective service provision” (p.7).

In this series of editorials, we will continue to examine social inclusion, through a gendered lens, as it relates to ICTs and digital media for learning, working, and inclusion in civic processes. In particular, we will look at policies and frameworks for learning with technology in public and higher education and continuing and professional education, working in technology-related fields, and participating in governance opportunities.

Employer retirement accounts are facing increasingly sophisticated attacks by hackers looking to get a slice of worker savings, and cryptocurrency investing is particularly at risk for scams, according to two financial-focused cybersecurity experts.

“We’re seeing a significant increase in the hackers getting access to these retirement assets,” Brian Edelman, CEO of cybersecurity protection firm FCI, said during CNBC’s Financial Advisor Summit on Tuesday. “We’re out there protecting them on the investment side, but we need to also manage the data—if a hacker gets at the retirement assets, then there is nothing left to manage.”

Edelman said during a panel discussion called “Securing Your Savings” that criminals will use a corporate email hack to intercept a conversation between a retirement plan saver and a plan administrator. They then try to get the participant to divert savings to a separate account run by the criminal.

Gregory Wilson, chief information security officer for Putnam Investments, said he has seen an increase in phishing attacks in which hackers send a fake message to take over an account and steal the assets. If these types of attacks are not stopped, there is a very short window of time for authorities to get the money back, according to Wilson.

“You need to get [the money] back in two days; otherwise, the ability to get those funds back drops significantly,” he said.

Both experts said fiduciaries for retirement plans should be well versed in guidance the U.S. Department of Labor put out last year on cybersecurity for retirement benefits. The guidance provides both best practices for ERISA-covered retirement plans and guidance on how to select a service provider with strong cybersecurity practices.

Wilson of Putnam said that while it is important for fiduciaries to follow the DOL guidelines, they should understand those guidelines are just a foundation to build on for the specific circumstances of a plan administrator.

“That is going to be the standard they are held to if something goes wrong,” Wilson said. “The thought is often to do the absolute minimum, but if something goes wrong, there are penalties, fines and institutional risk that comes into play. [Fiduciaries] need to do everything they can to entrust the assets.”

Crypto Concerns

Cryptocurrency investing, as a largely unregulated area, is particularly susceptible to cyberattacks, according to FIC’s Edelman.

“The bad actors have the ability to get into the system,” Edelman said. “It’s important to have encryption in place and a security professional who can help secure those assets.”

Cryptocurrency, while not prevalent in retirement plans, is available in some 401(k) plans and has been marked as a concern by the DOL.

On Monday, cybersecurity firm Privacy Affairs put out a study showing that cryptocurrency investors lost a combined $3.5 billion in 2022 to scams or “rug pulls,” in which a developer attracts investors and then runs away with the assets before the project is complete.

Meanwhile, the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has regulators calling for more enforcement on digital assets, and Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. issued on Monday a new guide on cryptocurrency-related asset management.

Wilson of Putnam says that at his firm, he conducts “tabletop exercises” in which a specific financial scam is set up, and teams work on them as if they were actually happening. He once had the FBI come in to run a scenario in which even he did not know the setup, he said.

Wilson noted that one of the biggest issues arises when a decision-maker is unavailable, and the company cannot act quickly. It’s important, he said, to have an active chain of command to mitigate that risk.

“Murphy’s Law says that when something goes boom, the person you need won’t be available,” he said. “You don’t want to be holding the bag without a way to contact that person.”

33,"DWS whistle-blower Desiree Fixler welcomes enforcement action as necessary to deal with greenwashing.

Regulatory efforts to prevent greenwashing by asset managers must be underpinned by stronger enforcement action, according to Desiree Fixler, ex-Group Sustainability Officer at German asset manager and whistle-blower on ESG-related failings at the firm.

“One of the best and most effective ways to keep bankers or Wall Street practitioners honest is through enforcement actions,” said Fixler.

“The recent regulatory and enforcement actions in the US and in Germany are the game-changer here. This is what it really takes, even more than the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), to clean up this market.”

Ex-CEO Asoka Woehrmann, who terminated Fixler’s employment, resigned from DWS last month following a raid by German police on both DWS’ and Deutsche Bank’s Frankfurt offices over claims of greenwashing. German prosecutors said the raid was “triggered by reports in the international and national media that DWS, when marketing so-called ‘green financial products’ had sold these financial products as ‘greener’ or ‘more sustainable’ than they actually were”.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation last August after Fixler claimed DWS’ 2020 report had misled investors by claiming that more than half of the group’s US$900 billion in assets were invested using ESG criteria, noting that there was no tracking system in place that could accurately calculate the proportion of ESG integrated assets. Fixler also raised concerns over the rigour of the firm’s process for integrating ESG ratings into investment decisions.

“This is the wake-up call for every ESG practitioner to substantiate their ESG claims. ESG statements and products have to be backed by substance, they have to be backed by action and, most crucially, data,” said Fixler.

“Had this crackdown and today’s scepticism and cynicism been around two years ago, DWS would never have greenwashed. [Woehrmann] would have thought twice about what he was doing”.

Fixer was speaking in a recorded interview conducted by Robert Eccles, Visiting Professor of Management Practice at Oxford University’s Said Business School, broadcast at City & Financial’s ‘Redefining ESG Best Practice and Disclosure Summit’, on 29 June.

Tougher fines, clearer definitions

The raid on DWS, alongside the US SEC’s recent issuing of a landmark US$1.5 million fine to BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, for omitting and misstating information about ESG investment considerations for funds it has managed, is cause for optimism, said Fixler. According to reports, Goldman Sachs is the latest firm to face scrutiny from the SEC over claims related to ESG funds.

In addition to enforcement action, the SEC has proposed two rule changes, currently open for consultation, which would require asset managers to justify their use of ESG labels. The first proposal outlines the SEC’s intention to expand the Investment Company Act’s ‘Names Rule’ to a wider pool of sustainable funds, requiring issuers to ascertain at least 80% of their fund’s holdings matches the label. The second proposal will amend reporting rules concerning funds’ and advisers’ incorporation of ESG factors in their marketing material, including annual reports.

Regulatory efforts to clamp down on greenwashing are already in progress in Europe. SFDR was introduced in March 2021, outlining disclosure requirements for funds and other financial products claiming to have sustainability-related characteristics and objectives.

In February 2022, 20% of funds registered under SFDR’s Article 8 were found to be ‘questionable’, in terms of the credibility of their ESG characteristics. In March 2022, sustainability technology provider Clarity AI said equity funds labelled as Article 8 under SFDR are no more aligned with the environmental taxonomy than non-ESG funds.

Yet, despite a lack of consensus in the European investment community on classification the ESG risks and impacts of funds, investment levels in SFDR’s Article 8 and Article 9 funds have continued to grow. According to Morningstar, they had reached €4.05 trillion at the end of December 2021, which represents 42.4% of all funds sold in the European Union.

Fixler said that the rapid growth of the ESG funds market had led to a situation where ESG could mean “everything and nothing”, arguing that stronger regulation and clearer definitions were required.

“We have to be just as accurate on non-financial disclosure, as we are in financial disclosure,” said Fixler. “ESG isn’t just this warm, fuzzy thing – it’s a driver for a big chunk of your business. This is adding a tremendous amount of top line and bottom line, and you have to back it all up with real data points.”

As well as increased mandatory regulation on ESG-related disclosures by asset managers and other financial service providers, there are increasing efforts to standardised sustainability-related reporting by corporates. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) aims to offer a ‘baseline’ for global sustainability reporting, and is currently finalising general sustainability and climate reporting standards.

“This is where we have greater definitions of ESG terminology,” Fixler said. “We have actual standardised reporting requirements. I think that this is the way forward to really try and deter greenwashing and at least mitigate the misrepresentation and mis-selling to investors.”

35,"Smoke and flames rise around the area as a result of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, on August 7. – Photo by the Anadolu Agency

For years, Palestinians, as well as Israelis, have labored to redraw the battle lines. The three-day Israeli war on Gaza, starting on August 5, clearly manifested this reality.

Throughout its military operation, Israel has repeatedly underscored the point that the war was targeting the Islamic Jihad Movement only, not Hamas or anyone else.

A somewhat similar scenario had transpired in May 2019 and again in November of the same year. The May clashes began when two Israeli soldiers were wounded by a Palestinian sniper at the fence separating besieged Gaza from Israel.

Mass weekly protests had taken place near the fence for years, demanding an end to the Israeli siege on the Gaza Strip. Over 200 unarmed Palestinians were killed by Israeli snipers, who were dispatched to the fence area as early as March 2018. The unexpected Palestinian shooting of the Israeli snipers was a temporary reversal of the bloody scene in that area.

Israel blamed the Islamic Jihad for the attack.

On May 3, Israel responded by bombing Hamas positions so that the latter may put pressure on the Islamic Jihad to cease its operations near the fence. The unstated goal, however, was to sow the seeds of disunity among Palestinian groups in Gaza who have, for years, operated under the umbrella of the joint armed operation room.

Like the latest August war, the 2019 war was also brief and deadly.

Another brief war followed in November, this time around involving the Islamic Jihad alone. Many Palestinians were killed and wounded.

Though Israel failed in breaking up Palestinian unity, a debate took place in Palestine, especially following the November clashes, as to why Hamas did not take a more active part in the fighting.

The conventional wisdom at the time was that Israel must not be allowed to impose the time, place and nature of the fight on the Palestinians, as was often the case, and that it is far more strategic for the Palestinian Resistance to make these determinations.

Israeli wars on Gaza are also a political insurance, as they reaffirm Washington’s support for Tel Aviv, via word and deed. “My support for Israel’s security is long-standing and unwavering,” President Biden said on August 7, as Israeli bombs rained over Gaza, killing 49 Palestinians, 17 of whom were children.

That position might be defensible when understood in a historical context.

For Israel, maintaining the status quo in Gaza is politically and strategically advantageous.

Additionally, the status quo is financially profitable as new weapons are tested and sold at exorbitant prices, making Israel the world’s 10th-largest international weapons exporter over the past five years, as of 2022.

Israeli wars on Gaza are also a political insurance, as they reaffirm Washington’s support for Tel Aviv, via word and deed. “My support for Israel’s security is long-standing and unwavering,” President Biden said on August 7, as Israeli bombs rained over Gaza, killing 49 Palestinians, 17 of whom were children.

Israeli wars on Gaza are also a political insurance, as they reaffirm Washington’s support for Tel Aviv, via word and deed. “My support for Israel’s security is long-standing and unwavering,” U.S. President Biden said on August 7, as Israeli bombs rained over Gaza, killing 49 Palestinians, 17 of whom were children. It is the exact same position of every U.S. administration in every Israeli war.

The Israeli military establishment too embraced this seemingly unchanging reality. The Israeli military refers to its occasional deadly war on Gaza as “mowing the grass.” Writing in the Jerusalem Post in May 2021, David M. Weinberg of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security explained the Israeli strategy in the most dehumanizing terms: “Just like mowing your front lawn, this is constant, hard work. If you fail to do so, weeds grow wild and snakes begin to slither around in the brush.”

For its part, the political establishment in Tel Aviv has learned to adapt and benefit from the routine violence. In 2015, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summed up his country’s position in a short but loaded sentence: “I am asked if we will live forever by the sword — yes.”

Ironically, in May 2021, the Palestinians were the ones unleashing the “sword.” Instead of keeping the tit-for-tat battle in Gaza confined to that small geopolitical space, the Resistance took the unusual step of striking at Israel in response to events transpiring in a small Palestinian neighborhood in Occupied East Jerusalem. Within hours, Tel Aviv lost the political plot and its control over the war narrative. It seemed as if every inch of Palestine and Israel suddenly became part of a larger battle, whose outcome was no longer determined by Israel alone.

The Palestinians call those events “the Sword of Jerusalem.” The name was coined in Gaza.

Ever since, Israel has been fishing for a new battle that would help it regain the initiative.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, for example, attempted to provoke such a fight in May, but failed. He thought that by moving forward with the provocative Flag March in Occupied Jerusalem, he would be able to drag Gaza into another war. Instead of war, Palestinians responded with mass protests and popular mobilization.

The latest August war was another such attempt, this time by the country’s new Prime Minister Yair Lapid. However, all that the militarily inexperienced Israeli leader could obtain was what Israeli military analysts refer to as “tactical victory.”

It was hardly a victory. To claim any kind of victory, Israel simply redefined the war objectives. Instead of “destroying the terror infrastructure of Hamas”, as is often the declared goal, it instigated a fight with the Islamic Jihad, killing two of its military commanders.

The typical Israeli media reporting on the war discreetly shifted, as if Hamas and other Palestinian groups were never enemies of Israel. It was all about Islamic Jihad.

“Fighting with the terror group would eventually have to resume,” The Times of Israel wrote on August 12, citing Israeli military sources. No reference was made to the other “terror groups.”

Unlike previous wars, Israel was in desperate need to end the fighting very quickly, as Lapid was keen on clinching a “tactical victory” that will surely be heavily promoted prior to the general elections in November.

Both Israeli military and political establishments, however, knew too well that they will not be able to sustain another all-out conflict like that of May 2021. The war had to end, simply because a bigger war was unwinnable.

Hours after a mediated truce was declared, the Israeli military killed three fighters belonging to the ruling Fatah Movement in Nablus in the West Bank. Lapid aimed to send another message of strength, though in actuality he confirmed that the lines of the battles have been permanently redrawn.

The Resistance in Gaza commented on the killing of the Nablus fighters by declaring that the conflict with Israel has entered a new phase. Indeed, it has.

CAIRO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - A top U.S. general emphasized ""very robust"" military assistance to Egypt as he flew into Cairo on Wednesday in the wake of a decision by President Joe Biden administration's to cut $130 million in military aid to the country over human rights concerns.

The rare U.S. censure of a geostrategic ally that controls the Suez Canal followed Egypt's failure to address specific human rights-related conditions, which have never been publicly detailed by Washington. Activists have said those U.S. conditions included the release of people seen as political prisoners.

General Frank McKenzie, who as head of U.S. Central Command is the top American military commander in the Middle East region, underscored rights concerns in comments to reporters shortly before landing. McKenzie also stressed that the cut in military assistance announced on Jan. 28 did not represent a large part of the $1.3 billion allocated by the United States for Egypt.

""Compared to the amount of other money that's in play, it's a very small amount. But I think it's intended to be a signal,"" McKenzie said.

""We still have a very robust weapons program with Egypt and we're still very heavily engaged with them,"" McKenzie added.

McKenzie, who is the most senior U.S. official to visit Cairo since Washington announced the aid cut, does not plan to shy away from America's human rights concerns in talks with Egypt.

""At the (military) level, we need to be honest with each other about factors that can influence the relationship. Clearly that's a factor that can influence the relationship,"" McKenzie said.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former Army chief, has been criticized for crushing dissent since coming to power after leading the 2013 ouster of elected President Mohamed Mursi of the now-banned Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood.

Sisi and his supporters have said security measures were necessary to stabilise the country. Authorities have recently published a lengthy rights strategy, appointed a national human rights council and lifted a state of emergency in place since 2017, though critics have rejected these steps as cosmetic.

U.S. officials have said the American relationship with Egypt is complex. The most-populous Arab country is a vital ally and key voice in the Arab world. U.S. military officials have long stressed Egypt's role expediting the passage of U.S. warships through the Suez Canal and granting overflight for American military aircraft.

Rights groups welcomed the Biden administration's announcement of the aid cut. But some saw it as just a slap on the wrist since it closely followed U.S. approval of an arms package worth more than $2.5 billion for air defence radars and C-130 Super Hercules planes.

Despite deep ties to the U.S. military, Egypt has moved to diversify its sources of arms after then-U.S. President Barack Obama in 2013 froze delivery of some military aid to Egypt after Mursi's overthrow.

Egypt's imports of arms from Russia, France, Germany and Italy have surged, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Any major arms purchase from Russia could trigger U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, known as CAATSA, U.S. officials have said.

""My message will be the inherent superiority of U.S. (weapons) systems and our desire to maintain a close partnership with Egypt, which would necessarily be affected if they executed large weapons sales with Russia,"" McKenzie said.

An evangelical view of immigration

By Bryan Fischer

Many evangelicals, due in part to the unfortunate influence of groups like the George Soros-funded Evangelical Immigration Table, have not had the chance to take a thorough look at what the Bible teaches about immigration. What follows is a contribution to this discussion among friends.

One often ignored principle in the evangelical debate over immigration policy is that the Bible clearly teaches support for the rule of law. Romans 13 makes this abundantly clear. Good laws are to be honored and respected by all. God has given to civil government authority to sanction and punish the transgression of its laws, which are designed to “ensure domestic tranquility,” as the Founders put it, by preserving peace and stability. As Paul put it, God’s desire is that our political leaders act in such a way that “we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way” (1 Timothy 2:2).

This makes any support for illegal immigration highly problematic for right-thinking evangelicals. An illegal alien, is by definition, a law-breaker.

So evangelicals ought to support legal immigration while firmly opposing immigration of the illegal variety. The orderly process of legal immigration allows us to screen those who wish to live here for criminal behavior and for disease, which compromise our national security and our nation’s health respectively.

Ellis Island existed primarily to screen prospective immigrants for communicable diseases. Such a concern is not mean-spirited in the least. It’s what a compassionate government does to protect the health of its citizens. In America, illegal immigration is responsible for the return of exotic tropical diseases and diseases which once had been eradicated on American soil.

Germany, which has now been overwhelmed by a tsunami of illegal immigration, is dealing with a host of newly introduced diseases including cholera, a disease that hadn’t appeared in Germany for 23 years. There is nothing compassionate about that.

Illegal aliens endanger our social stability in numerous other ways. Kate Steinle is dead, cut down in the prime of life by a man who had no legal right to be in this country, and had already been deported no less than five times. He kept returning to San Francisco for one reason: he knew San Francisco would not honor the rule of law. Kate Steinle’s family paid the ultimate price. There is nothing compassionate about that.

Virtually every day we read stories of illegal aliens, often previously convicted of crimes and deported, who murder and rape American citizens. South-of-the-border drug cartels are ravaging the peace of one community after another, straining law enforcement resources to the breaking point and endangering American families whose sons and daughters become victims of drugs and the violence associated with them. There is nothing compassionate about that.

We all recognize the difference between someone who breaks and enters through the back door of a home and an invited guest who politely rings the doorbell and waits to be welcomed in. In the one case, we call the police, who will courteously but firmly remove the intruders from a place where they have no legal right to be. In the other case, we invite them in and treat them to food, friendship, and fellowship.

Some evangelicals seem to speak as if borders are a hardhearted invention of callous men. On the contrary, the Bible indicates clearly that borders are God’s idea. Paul writes in Acts 17:26 that God himself is the one who has “determined…the boundaries” of nations. A border is not a border unless it means something and can be defended.

Evangelicals often forget that Moses honored national borders and national sovereignty in his day. When Israel approached the border of Edom in its journey to the land of promise, Moses’ request to sojourn in the land of Edom was rejected. When Israel was denied permission for a second time to enter the land by Edom’s king, Moses did not sneak into the country anyway. Nor did he barge in and demand hospitality and welfare benefits from the king. We are told instead that “Israel turned away from him” (Numbers 20:21) and went another way.

Assimilation, another value that is often dismissively rejected by pro-amnesty evangelicals, was an extremely high priority in God’s economy. In Numbers 15, the Lord himself instructed Moses that sojourners were welcome in Israel as long as they assimilated to the culture, the values, and the faith of their host country. Immigrants were instructed to leave behind their own religious values and their own customs, and adopt those of their newly adopted nation. When it came to worship, there was to be “one law and one rule…for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you” (Numbers 15:16).

Ruth is the model immigrant in Scripture. When she accompanied her mother-in-law back to Naomi’s home, she left behind her own gods and her own culture. Eloquently, she said, “Your people shall be my people and your God my God” (Ruth 1:16). That’s what assimilation looks like.

Now when someone follows the rule of law, is willing to assimilate (by becoming a non-hyphenated American), and is granted permission to immigrate, of course, he should be welcomed. We should do legal immigrants “no wrong” and should embrace them. “You shall love him (the sojourner) as yourself,” God says, “for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 19:34).

The plain fact is that America has honored this principle of embracing newcomers more than any other nation in the history of civilization. Our immigration policy is the most open-hearted and open-handed policy in the world. Every year, we grant legal admission to over one million foreigners and student visas to 700,000 more.

According to Julia Hahn, writing at Breitbart, “a review of public data from the World Bank and U.S. Census Bureau shows that there is no other country on Earth that has accepted even a fraction of the immigrants admitted to the United States over the last 40 years.”

We have a higher foreign-born population percentage than any of the world’s largest countries. Although we represent just 5% of the world’s population, we take in 20 percent of all the migrants worldwide. No other country even approaches five percent. We have, relative to population, taken in 24 times as many migrants as the pope’s home country of Argentina, 40 times more than Mexico, and 75 times more than Brazil. We have taken in six times as many as all of Europe, even though the population of Europe exceeds ours by more than 50 percent.

In other words, we have not only done our fair share, we have done far more than our fair share. And why have we done so? For one reason: this is a Christian country whose values have been shaped by the Judeo-Christian tradition. We have a record of which we can be proud and which calls for no apology.

Now every nation can only absorb a finite number of immigrants before it begins to sag under the added weight. A sponge cannot absorb any more water once it has reached its saturation point. And America may well have reached that point. Real hourly wages are lower here than they were in 1973, and almost all the net job creation from 2000-2022 has gone to foreign workers.

Calvin Coolidge reduced immigration rates in his day (1924) so newcomers could fully assimilate into American life and so that the crush of absorbing so many strangers would not overwhelm us and hamper our ability to receive newcomers in the future.

Said Coolidge, “We want to keep wages and living conditions good for everyone who is now here or who may come here. As a Nation, our first duty must be to those who are already our inhabitants, whether native or immigrants. To them, we owe an especial and a weighty obligation.” That’s compassion, both for the native-born American, for the foreign-born American, and for those who wish to become Americans in the future.

Bottom line: biblical immigration policy will reflect both justice and compassion, not one at the expense of the other. Biblical immigration policy will honor the rule of law, the sovereignty of our national borders, the importance of assimilation, and the importance of embracing those who have the legal right to be here. A Christian nation can do no less.

38,"Labor Day is a day of rest that commemorates years of war. Congress inaugurated the holiday just days after President Grover Cleveland sent 12,000 federal troops to break the Pullman strike. The tactics were bloody; US deputy marshals killed two men and wounded many more.

That was 1894, an election year. Cleveland needed a way to win workers back to his side. He saw an opportunity in a federal holiday honoring workers — as well as organized labor.

""The movement for a national Labor Day had been growing for some time,"" writes PBS NewsHour. ""In September 1892, union workers in New York City took an unpaid day off and marched around Union Square in support of the holiday. But now, protests against President Cleveland's harsh methods made the appeasement of the nation's workers a top political priority. In the immediate wake of the strike, legislation was rushed unanimously through both houses of Congress, and the bill arrived on President Cleveland's desk just six days after his troops had broken the Pullman strike.""

A simple place to start the discussion of rights and wrongs is with Labor Day itself

Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor, said Labor Day would be ""the day for which the toilers in past centuries looked forward, when their rights and their wrongs would be discussed.""

He did not say it would be a good day for barbecues.

A simple place to start the discussion of rights and wrongs is with Labor Day itself. Labor Day is a federal holiday, which means that federal employees get the day off, and some federally chartered businesses have to give their employees the day off. But there's no guarantee that workers in private businesses will get the day off with pay — Time reports that data collected by Bloomberg BNA shows roughly 40 percent of employers require some employees to come into work on Labor Day.

It's not just Labor Day. The United States is the only developed country in the world that doesn't guarantee workers in private businesses any paid days off at all, as this chart from the Center for Economic and Policy Research shows:

This isn't to say that paid vacation days are unknown to American workers. Many, even most, workers get a few each year. Workers with in-demand skills won't accept a job where they can't take a day off now and again. But workers with less bargaining power often have to accept jobs where they don't get paid days off. The result is that the people with the worst jobs are least able to take the occasional vacation.

America is the richest country the world has ever known. We can afford to guarantee workers a few days of paid rest a year.

America’s labor market is on fire. There are far more available jobs than workers and the latest data on initial weekly unemployment claims underscores that imbalance.

Initial claims for jobless benefits fell to 166,000 in the week ended April 2, adjusted for seasonal swings, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That was far fewer than the 200,000 or so claims that economists had predicted. It also matches the number of first-time claims from the week ended March 19, which was the lowest level since November 1968, after revisions.

The four-week average of first-time claims is now 170,000, after a series of adjustments by the DOL.

“We saw big revisions in this week’s initial and continuing claims figures due both to the usual annual revisions and a change in the seasonal adjustment procedure,” said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics.

The Labor Department announced changes to its methodology on Thursday.

At the start of the pandemic, the department altered the way it calculated its seasonal adjustments, since the swings in the data were so massive that the old way of doing things only distorted the data further.

But now that jobless claims have fallen back to levels seen before Covid-19 hit, the department is changing its methodology back to what it was before the pandemic. That’s why there were so many adjustments in Thursday’s numbers.

“The new data reveal a steeper initial claims downtrend through [the first quarter] but a less aggressive downtrend in the continuing claims,” Englund said.

Continuing jobless claims, which count people who have filed for benefits for at least two weeks in a row, stood at 1.5 million in the week ended March 26, little changed from the prior week.

The data reflects the tight US labor market, including the millions of jobs available across the nation and an unemployment rate that just hit a new pandemic-era low of 3.6%. Two years after the economy shut down due to the first wave of the coronavirus and millions of people lost their jobs, the nation’s employment situation is now characterized by a shortage of workers."

Photos obtained exclusively by the Daily News show Morgan holding a small child Wednesday near Mount Sinai Hospital. The wheelchair is part of the new reality for the popular comedian, who was seriously injured on June 7.

""This is the way he is now,"" Morgan's lawyer, Benedict Morelli, told The News.

""He has to use the wheelchair anytime he's out and about. He can't do that many steps. He's still unsteady. He has this head injury, and his leg isn't totally better yet,"" Morelli said. ""He has to struggle to inch along.""

Earlier in the day, a News photographer captured shots of Morgan outside his Cresskill, N.J., home.

The 45-year-old former ""Saturday Night Live"" star leaned on a cane and grimaced as he struggled to climb down the front two steps of his home. He moved gingerly, pausing between steps. But he soldiered on.

Dressed at that point in a white hoodie, jeans and a do-rag, Morgan came out to inspect some landscaping work that had been completed on his property.

The beloved comedian was met with encouraging smiles from people who appeared to be relatives, but the cane soon gave way to a sturdier walker and his progress appeared to be painfully slow as he inched his way to a waiting SUV.

It was a day of rare public sightings for the former ""30 Rock"" star who has struggled since a Wal-Mart truck slammed Morgan, critically injuring him and leaving him with a broken leg and broken ribs, and killing another comedian, 62-year-old James (Jimmy Mack) McNair.

Morgan needed weeks of rehab before he could stand up — let alone walk.

Morgan sued Wal-Mart for negligence, arguing the company was culpable because driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash.

Morgan also said Roper's commute — 700 miles from his home in Georgia to work in Delaware — was ""unreasonable.""

Comedian Ardie Fuqua and Jeffrey and Krista Millea, who were passengers in the limo, were also named as plaintiffs in Morgan's suit.

Wal-Mart blamed Morgan for not wearing a seat belt and denied any responsibility for the wreck.

In a statement, an incredulous Morgan said, ""I can't believe Wal-Mart is blaming me for an accident that they caused. My friends and I were doing nothing wrong.""

""Seat belts had nothing to do with"" the crash, Morelli added.

The US claims Huawei is used as a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies this.

The US has been lobbying allies to reject Huawei's 5G technology.

One major ally, the UK, decided to permit Huawei limited access to its 5G networks. Other allies are also not listening to US lobbying.

For over a year the US has been in a political dogfight with Chinese tech giant Huawei over claims the company acts as a proxy for the Chinese government to spy.

Although US officials have long cautioned against the company, tensions heightened in December 2018 when Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada, and subsequently indicted by the US for alleged bank and wire fraud. Meng and Huawei deny any wrongdoing, and the CFO is currently fighting extradition to the US.

Initially, Huawei struck a conciliatory tone, with CEO Ren Zhengfei (who is also Meng Wanzhou's father) breaking a long press silence to call Donald Trump a ""great president."" Since then, however, a fight has erupted between the company and the Trump administration, with Huawei denying any claims of spying and accusing the US of orchestrating Meng Wanzhou's arrest for political reasons.

The US has been furiously lobbying its allies to freeze out Huawei's 5G network equipment, citing national security concerns. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned allied countries in mid-February 2019 that it would be ""more difficult"" for the US to partner with countries that didn't distance themselves from Huawei.

President Trump ramped up the pressure yet further in May last year by signing an executive order declaring a national emergency over ""threats against information and communications technology and services,"" a move expected to precede a ban on US businesses buying equipment from Huawei. Since then the company has received three 90-day licenses, so the blacklisting has yet to fully kick in.

Still America continues to lobby against the company, but its efforts have been met with limited success. Here is a run-down of how allies have reacted."
42,"National Economic Council Chairman Gary Cohn stands at the North Portico before President Trump travels to Iowa from the White House on June 21, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

The White House on Thursday took the unusual step of saying that National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn would not resign, trying to contain the fallout from President Trump’s controversial comments about the deadly riot in Charlottesville over the weekend and his assertion that “very fine people” were protesting alongside neo-Nazis.

Cohn, who funded the Cohn Jewish Student Center at Kent State University in 2009, was mortified by Trump’s comments, three people close to him said, and he has been bombarded with calls from friends asking him if he will leave.

Instead, the White House said that Cohn plans to stay put and focus on advancing Trump’s economic agenda. It was unclear, though, how long Cohn would remain in the job or if he is still a leading candidate to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Worries on Thursday that Cohn might join the exodus of business leaders after two White House corporate advisory boards disbanded in the wake of the events in Charlottesville helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, the largest sell-off in three months. Investors feared that the Trump administration might lose a leading architect of the president’s economic agenda just as it approaches a critical juncture.

The White House needs Congress to vote to raise the debt ceiling and clear the way for tax cuts in the next few weeks, measures that have split the Republican Party and could face cliffhanger votes.

President Trump on Aug. 15 said that “there’s blame on both sides” for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)

Without Cohn, “a very solid stabilizing force in the West Wing will be lost,” said Camden Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group in frequent contact with the Trump administration. “Bottom line — not good.”

[Within Trump’s inner circle, a moderate voice captures the president’s ear.]

Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who has close ties to many business leaders, is seen as a key lifeline for executives who are increasingly wary about whether Trump will be able to secure the pro-business economic platform he promised during the campaign.

Trump on Tuesday revived his claim that “both sides” were to blame for deadly violence at a white supremacist rally over the weekend in Charlottesville, abandoning his message from a day earlier that branded members of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as “criminals and thugs.”

After Trump’s comments about the Charlottesville violence, Cohn spoke with numerous friends who asked him if he would step down, people familiar with those conversations said.

But others pleaded with Cohn to stay, with “some telling him, ‘You are our last hope, stay in,’ ” one of those people said.

People close to Cohn spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to breach the president’s rules about private conversations.

Congressional aides and some White House officials acknowledged that Cohn’s job has become much more difficult, because Trump’s comments further entrenched Democrats and alienated some Republicans who are ­nervous about what Trump might say next.

Meanwhile, some of Cohn’s internal rivalries show signs of worsening. White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon told the American Prospect magazine that he’s often at war with Cohn and other officials over issues such as whether to combat China over trade policy, among others.

“That’s a fight I fight every day here,” Bannon said, according to the magazine. “We’re still fighting. There’s Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.”

Cohn, who rose through Goldman Sachs from the trading floor to become its second in command, is known for a brash, combative style that has earned him friends and enemies. He was not a natural fit to be Trump’s top economic adviser because of his ties to Wall Street and New York Democrats, but Trump saw him as in­cred­ibly successful and a financial market “genius” who brought instant credibility to his economic team.

Cohn quickly consolidated power inside a White House that was often at war with itself and built a team of experts to work on health care, infrastructure, tax policy and other issues. Trump has relied on him for advice during meetings with chief executives, and he is often by Trump’s side during international summits.

He even had some success softening Trump’s nationalist impulses.

Cohn was part of a group that successfully urged Trump to back away from threats to impose large tariffs on all imports, and he also helped persuade the president to delay withdrawals from trade deals.

Still, some friends eye Cohn’s presence in the White House warily.

“I have encouraged him, encouraged him to leave before it became too late,” said a former Goldman Sachs executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation.

Cohn has tried to steer his aides away from Washington politics and focus them instead on getting results, even if they come slowly, or not at all.

During the furor over Trump’s comments this week, Cohn’s aides huddled on ways to implement the White House’s agenda on tax cuts and other changes while he golfed Wednesday with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.

It’s Cohn who meets with many of the chief executives hoping to offer an idea, or plead a cause, with the White House.

“Gary brings experience in how financial markets work and fail, through good times and stressful times,” said Erik Gordon, a law professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Gordon added that “if the president loses Cohn, he loses a window into the financial markets and the C-suites where investment decisions are made.”

Financial analysts worry that a decision by Cohn to leave the White House could open the door for other, less-business-savvy advisers to fill the vacuum, further roiling the increasingly nervous stock markets. Trump, for example, has in the past mocked Republicans for raising the debt ceiling, but many Wall Street executives say failing to do so could lead to a stock market crash and a recession.

If Cohn were to leave the White House, “there will be a material market sell-off,” Isaac Boltansky of Compass Point Research & Trading said in a research note to clients Thursday. “Our sense from client conversations is that his departure would surely dampen Wall Street’s already dwindling confidence in Washington’s capacity to govern.”

Cohn has at times mused to friends about leaving the White House or only staying there for a short period of time, but those who know him say that’s part of his personality, speculating things openly and then later brushing those thoughts aside.

“Nothing has changed,” a White House official said of Cohn’s status in the West Wing. “Gary is focused on his responsibilities as NEC Director and any reports to the contrary are 100 percent false.”

43,"Municipal staff collect organic material to be sent for a vermiculture recycling process in the commune of La Pintana in Santiago, Chile.

Every morning, trucks collect potato and avocado skins, orange peels and other food scraps that residents of Santiago's poorest neighborhood leave hanging in bags on their front doors or in tree branches or place in special bins.

For nearly two decades, the residents of La Pintana have been pioneers of recycling in Chile—South America's largest garbage generator.

Under a project started in 2005, the commune of 190,000 people enthusiastically gather their plant-based food waste, which is then turned into compost to help green their community.

In La Pintana, where 15 percent of people live in poverty, 50 percent of the community's organic waste is collected for recycling—a figure that puts to shame the 0.8 percent achieved by Chile as a whole, according to environment ministry data.

""They do a lot with it (the waste): they produce compost and it is used for the community itself, for the squares and gardens,"" La Pintana resident Jose Vera told AFP as he left two large cardboard boxes filled with scraps on the sidewalk, proud of his contribution.

""It is also a saving (for the municipality) because they no longer have to buy"" fertilizer or pay landfill fees, he said.

Chile generates some 1.13 kilograms (about 2.5 pounds) of waste per person per day—the highest output in South America, according to World Bank data.

The trailblazing recycling project in the La Pintana commune in Santiago, Chile, has received several international awards.

And in terms of recycling, it is far from achieving even Latin America's low average of four percent of solid municipal waste processed.

But La Pintana, one of the first neighborhoods of Chile's deeply socially unequal capital to adopt such a project, now collects some 20 tons of organic waste every day.

It is delivered to a local plant that turns the scraps into natural fertilizer for the town's own municipal nursery, and others.

'A change in people'

The municipality estimates to be saving some $100,000 per year—money that can go to other community projects.

""There has been a change in people,"" since the project started, resident Vera said.

""They are now concerned about recycling and no longer put the vegetables with the garbage.""

La Pintana's nursery, built on what used to be an unsightly landfill, yields some 100,000 plants of 400 different species every year.

Residents of La Pintana leave out fruit and vegetable scraps to be collected by municipal workers for the community's recycling project.

These are planted back in La Pintana, one of the areas of Santiago with the fewest green spaces per inhabitant.

The nursery uses about a ton of humus—a dark organic matter created when plant material decomposes—every year, according to project member Cintia Ortiz.

All of it is obtained from La Pintana's plant waste.

""This humus, the benefit it gives us, is that it is organic... thanks to the community and the workers,"" Ortiz told AFP.

In addition, ""as we can keep the plants well-nourished, we do not have to use chemicals.""

Planting flowers outside a municipal sports center, municipal worker Jeanette Gonzalez told AFP the project ""brings us... joy. The town is improving.""

""When we took over... it was a town where every 200 meters there was a landfill,"" Claudia Pizarro, mayor of La Pintana since 2016, said of the trailblazing project, which has received several international awards.

La Pintana's nursery, built on what used to be an unsightly landfill, yields some 100,000 plants of 400 different species every year.

""It is a virtuous circle: people see that where there used to be a landfill there is now greenery and everything is flourishing, and they stop throwing garbage there,"" she added.

There have been spillover benefits too: more than half of the municipal nursery's 15 staff are former inmates doing community work in lieu of serving prison time.

Chile's Environment Minister Maisa Rojas recently proposed a bill to reproduce the project in the rest of Chile.

44,"Start with a strong foundation

“From my first lemonade stand, I knew I wanted to start a business growing up,” Habib says. “I was always interested in economics and business, and I liked the idea of creating something that you can sell to a lot of people.”

When he approached his mother with the idea of bottling the recipe she and his grandmother had perfected, she was all-in. And Yo Mama’s Foods — a cleaner, fresher packaged sauce option that would bring people together around the table — was born.

Appropriately, the brand launched on Mother’s Day 2017. Five months later, Yo Mama’s was available on Amazon, and according to Habib, by December of that same year it had become the best-selling sauce on the platform, a distinction it still enjoys today.

Over the past five years, Yo Mama’s has expanded its product line to include a variety of sauces, dressings and oils. As the founder and CEO of Yo Mama’s Foods, Habib provides some insights on how his business is still able to thrive despite rising costs.

Own the supply chain

Habib can’t stress enough how important it is for any business looking to survive these inflationary times to own the supply chain. “Like many other consumer good brands, our manufacturer would source all raw materials for production, and they would take a margin based on their raw cost of the finished product,” he says.

“Because we weren’t using preservatives and the ingredients were clean, natural and fresh, our costs were higher. As a result, the manufacturer’s margin was, too,” he continues. “Sometimes their cut would be more than we were making on a specific sale. So we started something called ‘toll packing,’ where we took ownership of all the supplier relationships, and then the manufacturer was only responsible for cooking and packaging. This increased our buying power, allowed us to develop supplier relationships early on and created a solid foundation for scaling the business.”

Diversify suppliers

Habib admits that owning the supply chain isn’t enough — you have to keep your options open.

“Diversification of suppliers has been instrumental to us. And making sure there are three or four vendors we can purchase every item from — whether it’s tomatoes, labels, caps or glass jars — has been key for us to keep costs down,” he says. “For example, our overseas jar vendor increased their price by 30% last week. We called our U.S.-based vendor, who is not dealing with the same container ship pricing issues, and doubled our forecast for the next two quarters. We’re saving money and getting an additional volume discount, while protecting our costs to ultimately avoid unnecessary increases for the end customer.”

View every price increase as an opportunity

Habib has learned that sometimes it takes a disruptor like a significant price increase to give you courage to make a major change.

“For us, it was the inflated shipping costs. We supply fresh tomatoes from California, because even though the tomato industry in Florida is huge, there are no tomato processors here. With most manufacturing occurring on the East Coast, we have always paid to ship our tomatoes from the West Coast to the East Coast,” he says. “Well, shipping rates have more than tripled since 2019. We were paying about $2,200 to ship from California to Florida. This year, that cost jumped closer to $7,500. We started looking at how we can reinvent our supply chain by working with local Florida growers who are actually over-producing tomatoes to reduce waste, save costs, reduce our carbon footprint and support local growers. We never would have had the courage to do that unless a major supply chain disruption occurred. We will have our first Florida Roma tomato this October.”

Be transparent with customers

Building trust with customers is one of the most important things for any business. “We’re really transparent with our customers, and we try to avoid any price increases,” Habib says. “Through 2021, we kept all of our prices the same and took the losses in our margin. But this year is the worst we’ve ever seen as far as price increases and supply issues. We just rolled out our first price increase of 2%, even though we are paying well over 18% more for everything we purchase. Our recipe for survival during this crazy time is to make less on every jar, but to sell more to make up for it. And when things get better, we know we’ll be well positioned at higher volumes because we focus on customer trust and loyalty.”

Build a war chest

Habib uses a tactic that helped mega companies survive the Great Depression. The idea is to save up enough cash to sustain the business during turbulent times for one to three months.

One way Habib has managed to reduce a lot of cash flow pressures is to always look at contracts. “We try to renegotiate them from, say, net 20 days to net 40 or 60 days,” he says. “Another thing we do is try to purchase as much as we can on our Chase Ink business credit card to ultimately create another 30 days to pay vendors and suppliers. If planned right, this gives us 90 days to pay for raw materials. Additionally, we get 1.5% cash back on every purchase, which gets reinvested straight back into the business.” According to Habib, this has been key to building the company’s war chest.

The Chase Ink Business Card has been key to the growth of Yo Mama’s Foods since day one and, according to Habib, it has helped them recoup unplanned expenses and scale the business. “We are able to put a majority of our purchases on the card, including 100% of daily shipping expenses, so we get rewards points. It really adds up when we’re shipping 2,000 packages a day. It allows us to reinvest the money back into our warehouse and get the right equipment, such as label printers, software, packaging tables, custom boxes,” he says.

Plan for the future

Habib is excited about the future and looks to grow his business with a Chase business line of credit. The goal: to gather families around the table through healthy and delicious foods, both here in the U.S. and around the world.

“Every other country is facing the same battles, where they’re cooking from home but they can’t find quality food that’s not loaded with sugar and sodium and preservatives. We export to seven countries now, and international growth is one of our key growth initiatives,” says Habib.

45,"Doug Woodring is director and co-founder of the Ocean Recovery Alliance, a nonprofit that brings together innovative solutions, technology, collaborations and policy to benefit ocean health. Steve Russell is vice president of the American Chemistry Council's Plastics Division, which leads efforts to ""reduce, reuse, recycle and recover"" more plastics through outreach, education and access to advances in technology. The authors contributed this article to Live Science's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.

We all know plastics deliver many benefits that make modern life possible. They help keep our foods fresher longer, reduce the weight of our cars so we use less fuel, insulate our homes so we use less energy, and keep countless medical supplies safe and sterile. While some plastics are recycled, far too many are not — and end up buried in landfills or littered where they can enter delicate marine ecosystems.

But new technologies that can harness the fuel content in non-recycled plastics could help remedy this. These technologies work as part of an integrated approach to managing waste geared toward creating value from trash — an approach dubbed sustainable materials management.

Cash from trash

One of the biggest benefits to this approach is that it helps everyone — from businesses to consumers to government — start to value materials that used to be ""waste."" And when people realize materials have value, everyone starts to think about how this value can be captured and put to work for communities. Not discarded. Not buried. And certainly not littered.

So why do plastics have an intrinsic value as a fuel source? Plastics are created primarily from energy feedstocks, typically natural gas or oil (mostly natural gas in the United States). The hydrocarbons that make up plastics are embodied in the material itself, essentially making plastics a form of stored energy, which can be turned into a liquid fuel source.

It makes sense that people are asking how to keep more of this valuable fuel in play, even after plastics are used, and how to keep it out of landfills.

One way, of course, is to recycle plastics whenever one can. Today, recycling technologies reprocess many common types of plastics: bottles, containers, cups, caps, lids and so on. Even many flexible plastics, such as bags and wraps, can be recycled at major grocery stores across the United States.

But what about the plastics that can't be economically recycled? They still contain embodied energy and largely untapped value as a new potential fuel source.

Getting fuel from used plastics

A new set of emerging technologies is helping to convert non-recycled plastics into an array of fuels, crude oil and industrial feedstocks. Processes vary, but these technologies, known as ""plastics-to-fuel,"" involve similar steps.

Plastics are collected and sorted for recycling. Then the non-recycled plastics (or residuals) are shipped to a plastics-to-fuel facility, where they are heated in an oxygen-free environment, melted and vaporized into gases. The gases are then cooled and condensed into a variety of useful products. Plastics-to-fuel technologies do not involve combustion. Depending on the specific technology, products can include synthetic crude or refined fuels for home heating; ingredients for diesel, gasoline or kerosene; or fuel for industrial combined heat and power. Companies sell the petroleum products to manufacturers and industrial users, while fuels can help power cars, buses, ships and planes.

Economics will likely drive adoption of this technology. For example, by tapping the potential of non-recycled plastics, the U.S. could support up to 600 plastics-to-fuel facilities and generate nearly 39,000 jobs, resulting in nearly $9 billion in economic output from plastics-to-fuel operations. And that doesn't even include the $18 billion of economic output during the build-out phase.

Plastics-to-fuel technologies are increasingly scalable and can be customized to meet the needs of various economies and geographies, so they do not require huge machines. [Plant Plastics Seed New Tech, from Miatas to Tea Bags]

The promise of plastics-to-fuel is particularly exciting as an option to recover materials that today may be buried, or in some regions, illegally dumped or burned in open pits due to inadequate waste management infrastructure. The new facilities could create local revenue for communities in parts of the world where trash has become a hazard and a large source of marine litter.

A cleaner fuel

Another potential environmental benefit of plastics-derived fuels is that they can deliver a cleaner-burning fuel, due to the low sulfur content of plastics. Many developing economies currently use diesel with relatively high sulfur content.

The main product of fuel from plastic, when refined properly, is a diesel with greatly reduced sulfur content. Using this lower sulfur content fuel for boats, machinery, generators and vehicles can help decrease sulfur-related impacts while reducing non-recycled materials along the way.

Plastics-to-fuel technologies are expected to be particularly helpful in island nations where fuel prices are high and landfill options are limited. Communities now have the potential to create some of their own fuel locally, providing economic and environmental benefits, while removing a portion of the waste stream that potentially causes harm to their waterways, reefs, and tourism.

These are just some of the reasons our two organizations — one representing America's plastics makers, the other a nonprofit dedicated to a trash-free ocean — teamed up to create two new tools aimed at helping communities around the globe evaluate their potential to adopt plastics-to-fuel technologies.

If you're a topical expert — researcher, business leader, author or innovator — and would like to contribute an op-ed piece, email us here

The ""2015 Plastics-to-Fuel Developers Guide"" and the ""Cost Estimating Tool for Prospective Project Developers"" were designed to help potential investors, developers and community leaders determine whether this rapidly growing family of technologies could be a good fit for meeting local waste management needs and local demand for the relevant commodities.

Available at no cost, these tools provide, for the first time, an exploration of available commercial technologies, operational facilities and things to consider when developing a business plan.

We first announced the tools at the fourth annual Plasticity Forum held in Cascais, Portugal, in early June. Each year, the Plasticity Forum draws hundreds of global thought leaders in the areas of policy, design, innovation, waste management, retail/brand management and more. And earlier this month, we introduced the tools at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's ""Building Better Cities"" Forum in Cebu, Philippines. Today, banks and investors are reviewing the online tools to evaluate investment opportunities.

Plastics — even used plastics — are valuable materials that can be used to create new products or fuels and energy. But not if we bury them in landfills or dump them in our waterways. Plastics-to-fuel is one of several technologies that can play a role in converting non-recycled plastics into valuable energy (gasification and refuse-derived fuel are two others). Because no two communities are the same, it is important for individual regions or municipalities to understand which technology is likely to work best for them.

Hopefully, these new tools will make that decision a little easier.

46,"Grand Prairie ISD is getting into the learning groove after completing its first week of virtual school.

And despite the major fire at the Poly-America plastics plant last Wednesday, few disruptions were logged.

“Other than a bit of nervousness about the fire, there was no impact to the district,” said Sam Buchmeyer, a spokesman for Grand Prairie ISD. “It didn’t affect our communications or virtual learning and it didn’t affect the David Daniels Elementary Academy campus which is close to Poly-America. We’ve been keeping tabs on the air-quality issue, but there haven’t been any problems there either.”

Feedback on virtual learning has been positive from most campuses, as the 26,000-plus-student district has worked to aid families who lack technology access, Buchmeyer said. Some 450 mobile wi-fi hot spots were distributed last week to families who needed them, and about 5,600 devices were deployed to accommodate grades prekindergarten through second.

The district is also working to assist students from afar with virtual counseling efforts for students in sixth through twelfth grades, and with a weekday meal pickup service at five different locations across the city."
47,"Let’s start with a short quiz: Who said the following, Donald Trump or Joe Biden?

“Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.”

Answer: Joe Biden. And he didn’t say it in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 2020. He said it during the recent State of the Union.

My company, Auxin Solar, is trying to do just that—“make it in America.” And now we’re being vilified for that commitment to rebuilding the supply chain for a critical piece of the country’s renewable energy future.

We filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Commerce to close a loophole being exploited by China—to ship cheap solar products to the United States through third countries—in order to undercut U.S. solar producers. The companies targeted in our petition advertise that they can evade U.S. tariffs imposed on dumped and subsidized Chinese products. This is blatant circumvention of U.S. antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws.

When we think about halting the impacts of climate change, solar is necessary among electricity-generation sources. Yet without a domestic industry producing solar panels, we are forced to rely on solar products produced through Chinese coal-fired electricity and transported across the ocean on long-haul container ships. These imported panels are not “green.” How can we meet our goals to reduce carbon emissions if we depend on carbon-intensive international transportation and Chinese coal-fired power plants?

We also can’t have energy independence if we rely on foreign suppliers to sell us the solar panels that we connect to our electric grid. COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have crystallized why America’s dependence on foreign suppliers is now a national security issue. If our adversaries can choke us off from necessary imports, then we’re at their mercy. These risks are especially acute when the vast majority of America’s solar panels are produced by companies in China—and outside China—that are affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party.

We also can’t support human rights and turn a blind eye to China’s slave labor practices. Right now, there are companies that are buying solar inputs from factories that use slave labor. The only reason they’re not getting caught is because the slave labor is in the basement, while they import “clean” solar products from the first floor.

Just a few weeks ago, my business partner and I took two risks that I never thought we’d take. First, we personally signed for loans to upgrade our equipment and expand production. Second, we filed a trade case with the Commerce Department to level the playing field for American-made solar products.

Since we filed the trade case, we’ve become a target. We’ve faced retaliation. We’ve been hacked by the Chinese. We’ve been subject to racist vitriol on social media. Our customers are threatened with Chinese retaliation if they continue to buy from us. And in contrast, cheap solar imports from China are backed by well-funded special interests and highly-paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. Some of them argue that our petition is going to undermine America’s climate change efforts. But really, they’re only concerned with profit and shareholder return, and gaming the system by refusing to fairly price Chinese-made solar cells and panels.

Our opponents contend that we’re putting the climate at risk because solar installations will decrease if solar panel costs increase. But with a level playing field, costs will not increase. Republicans and Democrats alike agree with us. And so does President Biden. In his State of the Union address, the president noted the higher international shipping costs, the costs of factory closures, and the costs of warehousing now being borne directly by American families.

These costs can all be avoided by shifting to domestic solar manufacturing. And Members of Congress agree. In fact, a bipartisan House group recently sent a letter to President Biden urging support for our trade case against Chinese solar products being sold at below-market value.

In 1954, Bell Labs in New Jersey created the first silicon solar cell. It was created here in the U.S. And then China stole that technology. Auxin Solar is dedicated to reshoring this important supply chain.

American companies play by the rules. When the playing field is fair, American companies win. It’s time to give U.S.-made solar a chance once again.

Mamun Rashid is the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Auxin Solar, a solar module manufacturer in San Jose, California."
48,"Johnny Carson's wife WAS having an affair with ex-NFL star Frank Gifford claims New York P.I who broke into her secret apartment with the 'Tonight Show' star 43-years ago

New York private investigator Joe Mullen claims Johnny Carson's second wife Joanne did have an affair with ex-NFL star Frank Gifford

Johnny Carson's friend witnessed the Tonight Show host secretly break into his wife Joanne's apartment in 1970 to see if she was cheating on him



Discovered six or seven pictures of NFL legend Frank Gifford in the home

Frank Gifford was married to his first wife Maxine at the time



They eventually split and now he is married to talk show host Kathie Lee

Legendary P.I: Joe Mullen a licensed New York private eye has has confirmed that Frank Gifford was Joanne Carson¿s alleged secret lover

Johnny Carson's wife Joanne was having an affair with former NFL star Frank Gifford revealed legendary New York private eye Joe Mullen on Thursday.



Mullen was named by Carson's former lawyer and one-time best friend Henry Bushkin as one of three other men hired by the late-night television star to break into the secret Manhattan apartment of his second wife in 1970.



Backing up Bushkin's claim that the gang discovered cast-iron evidence Carson's wife was indeed carrying-on with Gifford, Mullen also confirms that 'The Tonight Show' host broke down in tears when her infidelity dawned on him.



Mullen told the New York Post's Page Six, 'I confirm I was present, indeed an eyewitness to the events described by the author as the so-called ‘break-in’ of the apartment used by Johnny Carson’s wife, Joanne.



The head of the J.T. Mullen agency said, 'Break-in is a bit of a misnomer as no locks were picked and no windows broken.



'The group of us who accompanied Carson managed to convince the person on duty to let us into the apartment where we confirmed Carson’s suspicions, finding various framed photos of his wife with football legend Frank Gifford . . . and Gifford’s clothes were in a closet along with a bathrobe.'



While Mullen, who has worked as a private investigator in the Big Apple since he was 16 does not claim that he saw that Carson was carrying a .38 revolver, he does say that the popular personality cried.

In Happier Times: Johnny Carson and his bride, actress-model JoAnne Copeland, are shown after their marriage in August 1963 at left, and Frank Gifford is seen at right in his NY Giants uniform that same year

'At one point, Johnny leaned against the wall and began to sob. Once we had our evidence, we whisked him out of the apartment as quickly as we could.'



Described as being straight out of Mickey Spillane, Mullen's revelations contradict those of Frank Gifford's current wife, 'Today Show' presenter Kathie Lee Gifford.

The morning talk show host said on Tuesday that her 83-year-old husband could not remember whether or not he had an affair with Johnny Carson's second wife, as Carson's friend alleged in a new tell-all book.



The affair between former NFL star Gifford and Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970, while Gifford was married to his first wife Maxine.

Still together: This is not the first time that infidelity has been an issue for the former NFL star as his marriage to Kathie Lee (seen together in April) was rocked in 1997 from an affair

Reading the news: Kathie Lee opened up about the issue during her portion of the Today Show on Tuesday

Gifford married Maxine, his college sweetheart, in 1952 and were together for 26 years which means that the alleged Carson affair would have come during that time.



'I got the call and Frank was still asleep and... (she said) ""Tell me, tell me! It was a long time ago. Did you have an affair with her?""' she recalled saying.



'I can't remember, maybe?' she said as her husband's response.



'No it's not true,' she followed up quickly.



She was clear not to make total light of the claims, however, as she even threw in a jab about her husband's much publicized affair with a stewardess during their own marriage that was made public after it was revealed that the woman was paid by a tabloid to arrange the trysts.



'Although the man is capable of it as you know. It's not- he was friends with Joanne,' Kathie Lee said.

Expressive: Kathie Lee made light of the alleged affair, saying that her husband can't remember

Co-host Hoda Kotb held up one of the local newspapers that had the story splayed across the front page where Gifford is pictured with his then-wife Maxine and Joanne Carson is pictured with her then-husband, famed Tonight Show host Johnny.



Kotb mentioned that she thought that was Joanne in both pictures, and Kathie Lee was quick to note the similarities.



'She does look a little like Joanne doesn't she?' she said.



'It's never a dull moment in our house!'



The news of the alleged Gifford-Carson affair broke on Monday when Carson's friend Henry Bushkin released an excerpt of his tell-all book where he details how he and Johnny broke into a secret apartment that Joanne was leasing without his knowledge.

Loved Across The Nation: In this undated photo provided by NBC, Johnny Carson begins an episode of the ""Tonight Show"" as ""Carnac, The Magnificent!"" Sportsman and Commentator: Frank Gifford, seen in 1967 and (left) in his heyday (right), has a history of cheating and on Tuesday Kathie Lee said that he couldn't remember whether Joanne was a past lover Cheating past: Frank had two trysts with flight attendant Suzen Johnson (left) in 1997 while he was married to Kathie Lee (seen here in 2000)

'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me,' Carson reportedly told Bushkin.



'I also have an idea who the son of a b**** is that she's shacking up with.'



When they arrived at the apartment and saw six or seven framed photos of Gifford, who was also on television as a frequent commenter for Monday Night Football, Carson began to cry.



Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman, fixer and closest confidant and hits bookshelves on October 15th.



Gifford's well-publicized infidelities of the past add some semblance of credibility to the claims, as his affair with flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997 was splashed across New York City papers throughout the ordeal.



It came after he and Kathie Lee touted the strength of their marriage in infomercials for a marriage counselor and after they both told different versions of their personal histories in their respective biographies.



According to a 1997 article in People Magazine, Frank wrote about his cheating past but said that his third wife, Kathie Lee, cured him of that.



'I get along great with women, but there's no sexual undercurrent anymore,' he wrote in his 1994 biography.

49,"Nicholas Kristof writes a biweekly op-ed column for the New York Times. He has won two Pulitzer Prizes, and in 2011 he was a finalist for columns that focused on the world’s most impoverished and disenfranchised people. His just-released book, A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity, co-authored with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, combines scholarly research with concrete examples to show how ordinary people can make a difference in the world today.

A Path Appears is the subject of this interview, as well as a keynote address Kristof will deliver November 13 at 8 p.m. in UCSB’s Campbell Hall. His talk kicks off a conference on Democratizing Technologies: Assessing the Role of NGOs in Shaping Technological Futures, that will be hosted by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society and held in Corwin Pavilion on November 14-15. Visit www.cns.ucsb.edu/demtech2014/welcome for more information.

You open A Path Appears with a quote from the Chinese writer Lu Xun: “Hope is like a path in the countryside. Originally, there is nothing — but as people walk this way again and again, a path appears.” This is a lovely metaphor, but how applicable is it in a world beset with so many seemingly intractable problems? How do you derive hope that a well-trodden path will indeed result from many individual actions?

We have seen real progress. If you think about children dying each day, which is a very basic metric, the number has dropped about half since I started covering global poverty. Since 1990, 100 million children’s lives have been saved through pretty basic interventions.

In one of our chapters we talk about blindness. We saw a glaucoma operation that costs $40 and can be done by a nurse in 20 minutes that restored sight to a woman who had been blind for years. Things like this make us pretty optimistic about the world. We do have to acknowledge the challenges that exist, but it is also important to acknowledge that there really has been progress, and that we have a toolbox now of understandings that can enable us to address many of the remaining challenges.

The first section of your book provides numerous examples of significant changes that have been made by ordinary individuals — a micro-savings program in Malawi that enabled an impoverished couple to start a business; a Teach for America volunteer who works with 5-year-olds who otherwise would grow up functionally illiterate; a boy from the world’s largest slum (Kibera, in Kenya) who created the Kibera School for Girls. Your stories are moving and hopeful, but do they add up to the large scale change that is needed?

One of the crucial things that individuals can do is demonstrate what works and what doesn’t work. The Kibera School for Girls isn’t going to solve the global problem of kids out of school, but it can provide lessons for the state school system. For Kenyans it shows that kids in the slums are not helpless. These are demonstration projects that can also inspire others. I also think it is important for governments to step up to the plate; these are individual efforts that can fill in some of the gaps, and also show the way forward.

The second section of your book examines the role of charity. While there is no question that philanthropy can make a difference in the lives of some people (as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has done with regard to global health), critics point out that when the charity stops, the benefits also stop. Charities often fill in the vacuum left by government, which should be doing the job. In your view, what is the proper role of philanthropy?

One of the most crucial kinds of intervention is in advocacy. We can think about charities in the context of delivering services, and indeed that is part of their job, but advocacy is also getting governments to step up to the plate. They can also give more voice to those who don’t have one. If governments aren’t doing their job, people may argue that everything else is merely a drop in the bucket. There is some truth to that. But charity can have a transformative path for some individuals. You and I can’t get all 50 million kids who are out of school in school, but for modest sums of money we can help a few kids get the education they otherwise would not get. For those kids, it can be transformative. Just because you can’t help everybody, it doesn’t mean that you should help nobody.

In failed states it’s obviously much harder. But that’s not the typical situation. Usually when governments are failing, it’s because they’re making other priorities. The challenge becomes trying to get a government to spend a little less on military and a little more on education or health care, for example.

Successful efforts also provide a demonstration effect for other countries. If a neighboring country does better, then other countries notice it, and they step up to the plate, and they get a little better. In Africa, for example, there were a lot of countries with really bad governments, but some have improved and have shown others that your really can do good governance. For example, Rwanda has dramatically improved technology, agricultural development, and governance in ways that other African countries have really taken note of. It shows the region that they can have lack of corruption, and people realize they don’t have to pay bribes everywhere they go.

It doesn’t all work perfectly, but I think that just as bad governance can be contagious, so good governance can be as well. This is part of the process of scaling.

The third section of your book draws on recent brain research to argue that we are hardwired to be at least partly altruistic. (According to the psychologist Dacher Keltner, whose research you discuss, humans are 40 percent benevolent and 60 percent selfish.) You give many inspiring examples to make the case, but every day we are bombarded with evidence to the contrary: religious fanatics who post their gory executions on YouTube, the rise of xenophobia and nationalism everywhere. How can our better angels be made to overcome the demons that seem to lurk in all of us?

That is kind of a critical question. I think that part of it is contagion, that good behavior results in more good behavior. And I wonder if education can play a role in teaching kids more empathy. The power of women plays a key role here as well. This is one of the great challenges we face. I think over time the better angels have tended to come to the fore.

NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] are playing an increasing role in areas that have traditionally been the responsibility of government. Is this a good thing? Many NGOs are from the Global North; they are often beholden to their funders; they have been criticized as being the most recent incarnation of the “white man’s burden.” What do you see as the appropriate role of NGOs in making sustainable change in the Global South? Businesses? Social business?

I think that the general point you make is true, but I would push back a little bit that it’s not the entire picture. There are extraordinary NGOs from the Global South — for example, BRAC [formerly Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee]. These NGOs don’t suffer the backlash that American NGOs sometimes experience. I think that one crucial thing is for NGOs to do more listening. They need to have a lot of people from the countries in which they operate. Over time, gradually, these efforts can make a difference. Ideally, these countries [like South Korea] will develop, and can graduate from NGOs; NGOs will help the countries that are still lagging.

I think we’re beginning to see more of a role for business. There used to be a distinction made between for-profit companies as evil, nonprofits as noble. Now we know that things are a lot more complicated than that. There are some nonprofits that accomplish very little, and some businesses that do good. The thing to look for is the impact. For-profit companies can have a social mission as well; this is a model that potentially can do a lot. I think there is potential for more companies to step up to the plate. I think that they will have to, partly because if they want to hire and retain millennials, they’ve got to have that social engagement somewhere. That will be a source of pressure on companies to step up their social purpose. These are tough issues, and there are a lot of fine lines to be made. There are real trade-offs between for-profit roles and values. But I think that in general we are going to see, over time, the for-profits filling in more of the social purpose base that is being filled by nonprofits now.

What are your thoughts on the role of technology in forging the path that will improve the lives of the poor around the globe?

Technology has a huge role to play. Whether it’s health care or agriculture, there are enormous gains to be realized — technology can be transformational. In terms of social media, this can create a measure of accountability. If a government announces its education budget and $100,000 is going to a school in that town, and the people access that information and realize that there is no school in this town but that the $100,000 is going into the pockets of a corrupt mayor, that creates a toolbox for people to know what is going on. I think we are seeing, already, that access to information creates a toolbox for accountability; it makes it a little harder to steal money. I would say, though, that the banking applications of mobile phones are the most important of all. They enable people to store money safely, transfer money — that may trump everything else.

Although this is not a topic directly taken from your book, I have to ask you the same question I asked you when I interviewed you for The Independent in 2009. In 2000 you and your wife wrote a famous (and controversial) New York Times piece called “Two Cheers for Sweatshops,” arguing that while many factories are horrible, they are for most workers better than the alternatives. On April 24, 2013, an industrial building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, collapsed, claiming more than 1,100 lives and injuring thousands of others, the worst factory disaster in history. The factories in this building were making garments for major U.S. and European brands. Are you now down to one cheer for sweatshops?

The danger issues are the strongest argument against sweatshops. Workers may be able to choose to work or not in a particular factory for a certain amount of wages per day, but when the fire escapes are padlocked, the workers can’t negotiate the issue. There is nothing they can really do about a building collapsing. This is not information that workers can make a decision about. But I still think that the greatest need is for jobs, and the risk of working in a sweatshop has to be solved by moving countries to more capital-intensive ways. One of the reasons I feel this way is because one of Africa’s problems is that nobody wants to build sweatshops there; nobody wants to move manufacturing there. I think this is as great a problem as the sweatshops themselves. The only way this problem can be solved is that if countries get richer, as has happened in the West. I think it is really a function of economic development. Maybe one and a half cheers. [Laughs.]

In your final chapter, you comment: “We sometimes paralyze ourselves with the conviction that global problems are hopeless, but in fact this should be a remarkably hopeful time to be alive.” What are some of your suggestions for things that the readers of this interview can do right now to make a difference?

There is no one transcendent thing to recommend. It really depends what the reader is interested in. If the reader is interested in global development, then the Deworm the World Initiative is incredibly cost-effective; you can deworm a child for a year. If it is poverty in the U.S., then how about Reach Out and Read, where for $20 you can sponsor a kid. The program improves reading and gets kids ready for school. Or browse sites like GlobalGiving.org, which describes itself as “a charity fundraising web site that gives social entrepreneurs and non-profits from anywhere in the world a chance to raise the money that they need to improve their communities.” One of the basic challenges we face in the US is an efficacy gap — people can be judgmental about the needy and step away from it. We need to counter this.

Finally, of course, our own website is for people who have read the book and decide to do something. You can also follow us on Facebook, and Twitter, join our mailing list, and watch our three-part documentary series, which premieres on PBS on January 26.

51,"CHARLESTON, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--West Virginia American Water announced today that it has completed its acquisition of the Town of Cedar Grove’s water distribution system. The company now owns and operates the system as part of its Kanawha Valley system.

The Town of Cedar Grove, which served approximately 395 customers along Rt. 60 in Kanawha County, has struggled to maintain adequate service to its customers in recent years. Additionally, the town no longer had the means to continue maintenance and infrastructure upgrades on its water treatment plant and distribution system.

“We are very pleased to receive the Public Service Commission’s approval to acquire the Town of Cedar Grove’s water system,” said Robert Burton, president of West Virginia American Water. “We look forward to serving the town’s residents, and we thank Mayor James Hudnall for the many months of planning and discussions to get us to this point. West Virginia American Water will now take the necessary steps to provide Cedar Grove residents with quality, reliable water service for many years to come.”

Earlier this year, the Town of Cedar Grove determined that it was in the best interest of its customers to sell its distribution system to West Virginia American Water. Town officials noted that customers would benefit by receiving more reliable water service as a result of improved operation and maintenance of the system and investments by the company. The company recently acquired water distribution systems in the neighboring towns of Glasgow and East Bank over similar concerns.

West Virginia American Water has established an interconnection between the company’s water lines in Kanawha County and the town’s water system and will continue to make needed investments in the town’s water distribution system to reduce leakage, improve water quality, and provide more reliable service.

Effective today, Town of Cedar Grove water customers will become customers of West Virginia American Water. The average residential customer in Cedar Grove using 3,000 gallons will receive a water bill of $43.46 per month. Cedar Grove rates will increase annually until October 6, 2023 when customers reach the company’s standard rates as set by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia. Qualified customers may be eligible for a discounted rate through the company’s Special Reduced Rate program. Customers in need of financial assistance are encouraged to learn more on the company’s website or call customer service at 1-800-685-8660.

52,"Exhibitions celebrate anniversary of landmark native title decision

Published on 25 October 2022

The High Court’s landmark Mabo decision 30 years ago has served as the catalyst for three exhibitions to be launched at Rockhampton Museum of Art this week.

While celebrating the decision, the exhibitions each look at different aspects of native title, including truth telling, the relationships of Indigenous people to their land and the legacy of the man behind the Native Title Act, Eddie Koiki Mabo, and his family.

Rockhampton Regional Council Communities and Heritage spokesperson Cr Drew Wickerson said that the exhibitions provided a fascinating insight into some of the stories behind the headlines.

“While those who were around at the time will remember the High Court Decision and the headlines it created, these exhibitions delve much more deeply looking at some of the personal stories and recollections of those involved and what it means to them.

“These exhibitions celebrate not only the decision but what it means to Indigenous people, the strong bonds they have with their land and the spirit of reconciliation which followed,” he said.

The exhibitions are:

Collection Focus: The Colour of Country

Co-curated by Dr Melinda Mann and Mario Mabo

The Colour of Country reimagines the Rockhampton Museum of Art Collection to illuminate the relationships between Country and Indigenous people. This exhibition is curated to represent the cultural knowledge behind the movements and milestones across Australian political and legal history, namely the Gurindiji Strike and the Wik and Mabo decisions. These works depict the vibrancy of spiritual and physical beings of Country both ancient and present.

Until 15 January 2023

Legacy: Reflections on Mabo

Co-curated by Gail Mabo, Jonathan McBurnie and Kellie Williams

Bringing together artworks by Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists in the spirit of reconciliation, this exhibition celebrates the man behind the nation’s ground-breaking Native Title Act, Eddie Koiki Mabo (1936-1992). Mabo’s life, politics, activism and ongoing legacy are the inspiration for a broad range of sculptures, prints, installations and drawings from artists across Australia.

Legacy: Reflections on Mabo is a travelling exhibition presented by Umbrella Studio Contemporary Arts and toured by Museums & Galleries Queensland. It has been generously assisted by the Australian Government’s Visions of Australia Program and the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy, an initiative of the Australian, State and Territory Governments. It is supported by the Queensland Government through Arts Queensland and the Australian Government through the Australia Council for the Arts, its arts funding and advisory body.

Gail Mabo mines her personal and emotional archive to share a testament to the lives of her parents, Eddie Koiki Mabo and Bonita Mabo, as well as her own life in all its fragility. Mabo presents life-sized impressions of their respective childhood homes and laborious detail.

A travelling exhibition presented by Umbrella Studio Contemporary Arts.

Until 19 February 2023

The exhibitions will run concurrently at Rockhampton Museum of Art until early 2023. Entry to Rockhampton Museum of Art is free. More information: www.rmoa.com.au

What happened next was, for me, a crash course in leverage: The kind of leverage that gets you the money to purchase an NBA overlaps with … stuff that never came up in high school U.S. History.

Thank you for coming along on this journey as I learn, and for supporting TrueHoop in this work. (Your subscriptions are essential.) After pausing for the playoffs, draft, trades, and free agency, today the series enters its final few posts, with a peek at the secret business history of America’s most powerful—doing business with Hitler, represented by lawyers who went on to become the founders of American intelligence."

She met her life partner at Morgan Stanley, and the two welcomed the birth of their first child in November 2009, the year she was also promoted to Vice President. She then took on a role in the Investment Banking Division in 2012. More changes followed, including a move to a different city to raise her young child, which led to a new job at a startup in 2015.

But Kumar found she missed the professional development and learning opportunities she had previously experienced at Morgan Stanley. Through it all, she remained close to her former colleagues, who urged her to return to the firm. “Friends who know me said the only place I should go back to was Morgan Stanley. They knew how happy I was there.” Thanks to that network, she was eventually referred for a position as a Vice President in Risk Management in Mumbai, a job she was offered and accepted in February 2019. “It was like coming home,” she says

Kumar says her experience both inside and outside the firm has proved invaluable and has led to the sort of responsibility she may not otherwise have enjoyed. “I was given authority to decide what the requirements of the region are. I could call the shots,” she says."
