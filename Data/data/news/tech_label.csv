0,"Teslas include some unique features you can't find in other cars. Tesla

Tesla vehicles are engineered with a plethora of interesting add-ons and easter eggs.

The features reflect Elon Musk's unique sense of humor and have added to Tesla's cult following.

From sentry mode to dog mode or ""caraoke,"" here are 21 features that put Teslas in a league of their own.

1. Autopilot

All Tesla models are equipped with a driver assistance system called Autopilot.

The feature enables a car to steer, accelerate, and brake automatically within its lane. The function does not replace the role of a driver, but is intended to make driving easier and cut down on accidents.

New Tesla models have eight cameras and 12 sensors that provide a 360-view of the vehicle's surroundings, per the carmaker's website. In the past, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has compared the cameras to the human eye.

The system also features a $15,000 or $199 per month Full-Self Driving add-on which can change lanes, as well as recognize stop lights and stop signs. The feature is currently in beta testing.

In 2019, Tesla's got a new ""caraoke '' function which allows Tesla owners to choose from a vast selection of music and song lyrics.

The feature became especially popular in China. In January, the carmaker's $188 in-car karaoke microphones sold out within an hour of the initial launch in China. The TeslaMic is currently only available in China.

The ""caraoke"" music selection also features music in different languages. But don't get the idea that you'll be able to sing caraoke while driving, in order for this feature to work, the car has to be parked.

Tesla's Model X and Model Y, as well as more recent versions of the Model S and Model 3, are equipped with a HEPA filtration system that prevents toxic chemicals from getting into the cabin of the car.

The filtration system targets anything from pollution and bacteria to pollen, Tesla has said.

In January, Tesla released a demo video to show how the filter can protect its drivers from biodefense weapons.

Tesla is constantly updating its infotainment system with apps like YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu.

The system also has several options including Theater, Arcade, Toybox, and Browser. With the Arcade setting, drivers can use the steering wheel buttons or a USB controller to play full games.

The majority of the entertainment features are only available when the car is parked, but drivers have said it has helped them pass time when Teslas are charging or stuck in major traffic jams. Earlier this year, a Tesla driver said he watched Netflix while stuck in a 14-hour traffic jam in snowy weather.

There are more than 35,000 Tesla supercharging stations in the world -- a number that the company continues to grow.

Tesla says that you can charge your car for as little as 15 minutes for up to 200 miles of travel.

In the past, EV drivers have said that the fast-charging stations give Tesla owners an advantage over others due to their speed, as well as the wide availability of Tesla chargers.

Tesla Superchargers make up about 58% of fast-charging plugs in the US, according to the Department of Energy.

With your family pooch in mind, Tesla introduced dog mode to keep them in the car with the temperature of the car being regulated to avoid the animal overheating.

The touchscreen on the car will display a background letting curious bystanders know that your car is a comfortable temperature for your dog and that you will be back.

In December, Tesla released an additional feature that enables users to their dog in realtime while its in the car by transmitting a live feed from the cabin camera directly to the Tesla app.

Tesla also has an automatic climate control system for severe weather conditions.

The Cabin Overheat Protection system turns on when the interior of the empty car hits 105 degrees.

Musk said in July that Tesla's next software update will allow drover's to control at which temperature the cooling system comes on.

""Tesla's automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves,"" he said.

Tesla cars are equipped with a fart mode that allows your vehicle to sound like its breaking wind.

The driver can even choose which speaker the sound comes from to give the impression that the sound is coming from a specific seat or direction.

The carmaker used to have a boombox mode as well, which allowed driver's to replace the sound of their horn with anything from the sound of a bleating goat to a round of applause, but the feature was disabled in February over concerns from the NHTSA.

Most cars have a truck in the back, but why would Tesla pass up the opportunity to be anything less than original.

The frunk is just like a trunk, but in the front instead of the back — another feature quickly copied by competitors.

Since Tesla adopted the frunk other automakers have followed suit. For example, the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck also features a frunk.

1,"Investors care about the ESG (environmental, social and governance) profiles of large corporations more than ever. In 2019, S&P Global, the ratings firm behind the S&P 500 Index, introduced a new benchmark called the S&P 500 ESG Index, a weighted selection of about 300 public companies the firm believes have achieved a good balance between financial return and sustainability performance.

One would think Tesla, the world’s largest electric vehicle maker, would easily make the list and it did for several years. But not any more. In April, S&P decided to exclude the company from its ESG Index after an annual re-balancing. Meanwhile, the firm assigned a higher ESG score to Exxon Mobil, the largest oil and gas producer in the U.S., and included it in this year’s index.

S&P isn’t the only third-party organization with this view. In environmental index compiled by the University of Massachusetts last year, Tesla was ranked as a bigger air polluter than Exxon Mobil and Marathon Petroleum.

As ESG investing becomes a multi-trillion segment of the financial market, there is growing skepticism about how ESG funds select portfolio companies. Along with oil producers, weapon manufacturers and tobacco companies are still included in some ESG funds, although fund managers having been reducing exposure to these industries.

Is Exxon Mobil more green than Tesla?

The University of Massachusetts’ 2021 Toxic Air Polluters Index, which ranks 100 large corporations by the amount of air pollution using 2019 data (the most recent available), placed Tesla at 22, higher than Exxon Mobil (26) and Marathon Petroleum (28). The vast majority of Tesla’s air pollution stems from battery production at the company’s Nevada factory, according to researchers.

The S&P’s issue with Tesla is more social than environmental. In a blog post on May 17 explaining the re-balancing, the ratings firm cited Tesla’s “lack of a low-carbon strategy” and “codes of business conduct” as main reasons for rejection.

Specifically, S&P took issue with claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions reported at Tesla’s Fremont, Calif. factory, as well as the company’s handling of an investigation by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding the safety of its driver-assistant system.

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” wrote Margaret Dorn, S&P’s head of ESG Indices in North America, in the post. S&P didn’t explain in its blog post why Exxon is included in this year’s ESG index.

Also kicked off the index this year are Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, and Exxon’s rival, Chevron Corporation. S&P Global didn’t respond to a press inquiry why Exxon made the list while Chevron, Meta and Berkshire Hathaway didn’t.

The ESG Index’s methodology page lists a complex of selection criteria, including the type of business activity a company is engaged in, its financial performance, environmental impact, media reports, and how it treats stakeholders beyond shareholders including customers, employees and business partners.

The debate over how ESG is measured

S&P’s reshuffling of ESG companies prompted a blast from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” he tweeted on May 18.

Musk isn’t alone in questioning S&P’s scoring system. “All the top companies on the ‘rebalanced’ ESG Index list have been subject to discrimination issues and government probes,” said Rashida Salahuddin, president of the Corporate Citizenship Project, a consulting firm advising public companies on governance and ESG matters.

“The decision to remove Tesla is an illustration of how arbitrary and flawed the ESG rating and indexing system has become,” Salahuddin added.

Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 18, 2022

In its 2021 Impact Report released in early May, Tesla said current ESG reporting focuses too much on a company’s risk/return profile and not enough on social and environmental impact. “Individual investors—who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions—are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better,” the report says."
2,"When biting into a large, sweet apple from the local grocery store, it is easy to take the characteristics of our modern fruits for granted. We do not often consider the long history of migration and improvement, both random and intentional, that has led to the seemingly perfect apples we enjoy today. Were the apples of our past always delicious? Where did our apples come from and how much have they changed?

The origins of the apple can be traced back to the Tian Shen mountains in modern-day Kazakhstan, where the wild ancestor of apples, Malus sieversii, still grows in forests today. The largest city in Kazakhstan, Almaty, derives its name from the Kazhak word Almatau meaning “apple mountain”.

Archaeological evidence suggests that human cultivation of apples began at least 5,000 years ago. During the last five millennia, our human ancestors transported apple seeds first across Asia via the Silk Road and eventually across the world.

But these ancient apples are quite different from the varieties we are accustomed to today. Wild apples are often small, acidic and bitter and generally not something you would pay $8.80/kg for.

Cultivated improvements

Our research group compared today’s cultivated apples (varieties grown on farms like Honeycrisp and McIntosh) to the fruits of their wild ancestors, Malus sieversii, to quantify how apple fruits have changed over thousands of years.

Our experiment made use of Canada’s Apple Biodiversity Collection, an orchard in Nova Scotia containing over 1,000 different apple varieties from around the world, both wild and cultivated. Growing trees from the mountains of Kazakhstan alongside cultivated varieties allowed our research team to make direct comparisons between today’s apples and the wild apples of the ancient past.

Our study revealed that cultivated apples are 3.6 times heavier and 43% less acidic than their wild counterparts. The apples we see in supermarkets today are both larger and more palatable than those that fed our ancestors. This dramatic change in acidity, which contributes to the sourness of apples, suggests that the apples we enjoy today are much tastier than those of the past.

In addition, cultivated apples contain 68% less phenolic content than wild apples. Phenolic compounds are bioactive substances in fruits that are linked to improved human health outcomes. However, phenolic compounds also contribute to bitter taste, meaning the apples of today taste much less bitter than their ancestral counterparts.

It is likely that, over many centuries, humans chose to grow apples with less bioactive molecules in favour of those with a less bitter taste, resulting in decreased phenolic content in cultivated apples over time. These results give us some insight into the taste preferences of our ancestors. Humans of the past likely selected for apples that were heavier, providing more food for more people, and less acidic and phenolic, making them more palatable.

A large proportion of these dramatic changes happened as a result of our ancestors choosing which apple varieties to bring along with them as they migrated around the world. Over hundreds of generations, our ancestors selected apples that had traits that suited their needs, effectively conducting a long-term apple improvement experiment.

Modern breeding

In the past 200 years, apple breeding programs have been more deliberate and more sophisticated, using modern techniques and technologies to make apples better faster. Our group combined historical records with fruit trait data from our orchard to investigate trends in fruit characteristics among commercial varieties generated from the last 200 years of breeding.

Our investigation found that more recently released commercial apple varieties have better storage capabilities, contain more soluble solids (sugars) and have less phenolic content. Recent efforts to improve our apples have been focused on keeping fruits fresh for longer and making them taste sweeter. With the expansion of global food markets and our growing preferences for sweeter tastes, these changes are indicative of the desires of modern society.

Apple futures

Wild apples represent an invaluable source of genetic diversity – material that could be used in the future to add new or improved characteristics to modern apple varieties.

Maintaining diverse crop collections, like Canada’s Apple Biodiversity Collection, will be essential for the future of food improvement, as it allows agriculturalists to push the boundaries of what is possible with our fruits.

Indeed, when comparing apples to apples, the modern-day fruit you see at the grocery store has fallen quite far from the ancestral tree – and that is something to be grateful for.

Tommy Davies is a PhD student in Agriculture at Dalhousie University.

3,"Apples sold today are larger, less acidic, and have a longer shelf-life than their wild ancestors, according to a new study.

The research was published in the journal PLoS ONE by Sean Myles, an associate professor in agriculture at Dalhousie University in Canada.

Myles found that modern, cultivated apples were around 3.6 times heavier on average than the wild apples from which they descended.

He also discovered that they were half as acidic and much less bitter than those ancient heirloom varieties.

The research focused on fruit belonging to Canada’s Apple Biodiversity Collection in Kentville, Nova Scotia, an orchard that produces more than a thousand different apple varieties.

“Using historical records, we found that apple breeding over the past 200 years has resulted in a trend towards apples that have higher soluble solids, are less bitter, and soften less during storage,” Myles wrote.

“Our results quantify the significant changes in phenotype that have taken place since apple domestication, and provide evidence that apple breeding has led to continued phenotypic divergence of the cultivated apple from its wild progenitor species.

“Our work demonstrates that cultivated and wild apples have diverged phenotypically, and that hundreds of years of apple improvement have shaped the variation in fruit and phenology we observe among cultivated apples today.”"
4,"A few days after last year’s midterm election, a Google policy manager and lobbyist sent an email to a congressional staffer with a link to a blog post on the right-wing news site Red State, written under the name The Real DC. In the post, the author accuses Google’s competitor Yelp of prodding President Trump to tweet a “professionally designed” video about Google’s alleged bias, which The Real DC calls “fake news” because it “bears many similarities” to content produced by Yelp.

In the email, a copy of which was viewed by Wired, Ed An, the Google lobbyist, said he does not typically share articles from Red State but thought the staffer would find this one interesting.

Neither Red State, its publisher Townhall Media, nor its owner Salem Media Group responded to repeated questions about The Real DC. In a statement, An, the Google lobbyist, said he has no knowledge “of the author who goes by The Real DC.” Yelp Vice President of Public Policy Luther Lowe denied any connection to the video or tweet.

The Real DC appears to have posted seven times on Red State. The posts touch on a range of policy issues, such as mortgages, ticket sales, and shareholder rights. All are topics that align with the clientele of a Washington, DC, public affairs firm called CLS Strategies, which first worked with Google in 2008, when Google was trying to stop Microsoft’s potential acquisition of Yahoo. On its website, CLS lists as a client the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade association in which Google is an influential member. The Real DC first posted about Yelp in March 2018, after Lowe, a vocal anti-Google instigator, called CCIA the “shadiest front group for Google.”

CCIA has proudly defended tech innovators over its 45 year history, including on issues like intermediary liability where we align with @yelp's @lutherlowe. But we're not fans of astroturf efforts that try to subvert legitimate competition: https://t.co/Y2DapaYPKK — Springboard Initiative (@springboardccia) March 8, 2018

CLS declined to comment. CCIA President Ed Black said, “A good look at our website and history will show our strong independent streak amid a diverse membership."" CCIA’s relationship with CLS ended in August 2017.

A spokesperson for Google said the company would never ask someone to write an anonymous piece. ""We are transparent about our policy work—we disclose all significant affiliations and grants on our transparency page and we require all people whose work or research we fund to disclose that fact,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Still, the email offers insight into how Google, a shrewd Washington player, has shifted into overdrive and adapted its approach as calls to regulate Big Tech have grown louder.

In the latest sign of the more hostile environment for tech, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week issued a far-reaching plan to break up dominant tech platforms; she suggested Google be required to unwind its acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick. Rebukes from the right are just as vehement. During a congressional hearing on monopolies last week, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) lit into tech companies. “When they spy on their consumers, when they take data without disclosing it, when they use it for things that consumers have not approved, I mean every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies’ behaviors,” he said.

At the hearing, Hawley, who launched an investigation into Google while he was Missouri attorney general, also challenged Joshua Wright, a former Trump adviser and professor at George Mason University, who wrote academic research funded indirectly by Google and criticized antitrust scrutiny of Google before joining the Federal Trade Commission as a commissioner from 2013 to 2015. “As someone who comes from the conservative or libertarian side of the street, should we be concerned” about cronyism from large companies?"" Hawley asked. On Tuesday, Hawley cosponsored a bill to prevent tech companies from collecting data on children. Wright says his views have ""attracted like-minded supporters"" as the antitrust debate intensifies.

The Big Tech giants regularly abuse the public trust - spying on consumers, taking data without consent, discriminating against conservatives. Then they wonder why citizens are angry? Time to hold them accountable pic.twitter.com/m4vSNUKOBp — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) March 5, 2019

Google is very active in shaping public policy. Last year, the company reported spending $21 million on federal lobbying, more than any other company in America. Google was also the highest-spending corporate lobbyist in 2017.

Over the past year or so, the network of academics, think tanks, trade organizations, and advocacy groups funded by Google has repeatedly come to its defense at key moments, such as after Warren’s broadside, the days after the midterm elections, and the weeks surrounding Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s December appearance before Congress. When Trump took office in January 2017, Google listed 141 organizations that receive funding from the company’s public policy division. Since then the number has more than doubled, to 349.

Op-eds by antitrust and privacy experts sympathetic to Google’s views have appeared on right-wing and cable news sites. In the editorials, the authors frame populist fervor to regulate Big Tech as the work of unserious “hipster antitrust” activists who don’t understand the law and argue that consumers are better off with the status quo.

Scholars and experts may hold these positions independent of financial incentives from tech companies like Google, but both regulators and the public are sometimes left in the dark about potential conflicts of interest. Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy, coauthored an op-ed in The Washington Post in January about the tech backlash “going askew.” Google’s donation to the Georgetown Center was not noted on its transparency page until about 10 days later, according to records from Archive.org. A Google spokesperson said the company updates its page twice a year. Downes did not respond to a request for comment. Georgetown said as a private university it does not disclose donor information.

Warren’s post last week brought out some of Google’s reliable defenders, like Geoffrey Manne, head of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonprofit research group that receives money from Google; Wright was previously director of research there and coauthored some papers with Manne. Manne’s conflicts of interest have previously attracted attention, including New York Times articles in 2015 and 2016 that mentioned funding the center received from Comcast during the net neutrality debate.

A rebuttal to Warren, coauthored by Manne, argued that Google might stop investing in improving its products if it is regulated. He said a decline in business dynamism, cited by Warren, could be because entrepreneurs want to sell their startups to big companies, contradicting founders who say they would rather become the next Mark Zuckerberg than sell to him.

Manne’s piece was shared approvingly on Twitter by the executive vice president of the Cato Institute and the VP of policy at the Niskanen Center—both of which receive funding from Google—as well as by a senior research fellow at the Koch Institute (a recent Google ally on antitrust) and assorted venture capitalists and was eventually published by CNBC. Manne did not respond to a request for comment.

Google began stepping up its Washington game around 2011, as the FTC investigated whether the company was improperly exploiting its dominance in search. The Wall Street Journal reported that FTC staffers found that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior that harmed rivals and users, but in 2013 the commission decided not to bring charges against Google, which made some voluntary changes. Around this time, Google began courting conservatives to mitigate concerns over its close ties to the Obama administration.

The company has also excelled in less formal efforts to influence conversation, through donations to academics, think tanks, trade organizations, and advocacy groups, on both the left and the right, that steer debate toward policy positions that benefit Google in conferences, congressional hearings, and editorials that often do not disclose a speaker’s financial ties to Google.

A person familiar with Google’s strategy for influencing public debate says the company generally doesn’t seek to change experts’ thinking but, rather, to underwrite their time and encourage them to be more vocal on issues important to Google. Google may pre-vet op-eds and ask that certain statements be made stronger or weaker, which seems small but ends up having a big impact, the person said. Google did not respond to a request for comment on reviewing op-eds.

“Google is much savvier at this game than Comcast or AT&T in that it doesn’t pay for strict quid pro quos. Its strategy relies on social capture,” one congressional staffer told Wired. Google finds an organization that seems to share Google’s values and then donates money without a specific ask, the staffer said.

But Google’s tactics backfired last year when its employees revolted against the company’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference, attended by white nationalists and members of the anti-LGBT movement, and where speakers included French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen.

Google did not sponsor this year’s conference, held in late February and early March. But Google was still there, indirectly. The company funds at least eight think tanks and nonprofits whose officials spoke or who sponsored events at CPAC, including Americans for Tax Reform, the Heritage Foundation, National Review Institute, and the Federalist Society. Google has been funding the American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC, since 2012.

In a statement, Google said, ""We have very openly engaged with policymakers and organizations from across the political spectrum for over a decade to advocate for policies that help consumers and our employees, and that keep the internet an engine for innovation and economic opportunity."" The company’s public policy director, Adam Kovacevich, laid out the team’s tactics last year during an employee meeting to explain Google’s sponsorship of CPAC, according to an audio recording previously reported by Wired. “[W]e try to influence policymakers by allying with the people that they listen to, the network of advocacy groups, think tanks, grassroots organizations on both the left and the right,” Kovacevich said. “If we want policymakers to help us when we have a bad bill or a regulation pending, we have to build relationships with them ahead of time. And so a big part of our work in the DC office across all of our team is building relationships not only with the people in power but also the people who influence them.”

Google’s influence is extensive. During a February hearing on protecting consumer privacy in front of a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, three of the five speakers represented groups that receive money from Google: American Enterprise Institute, Center for Democracy & Technology, and the Interactive Advertising Bureau. A fourth represented the Business Roundtable.

Wish I could’ve got in a few more hits on this, these companies are built on the concept of radical transparency premised on unfettered access so they have no interest in privacy legislation that would give communities and consumers powers and protections... https://t.co/Kfd1asdPi4 — Brandi CD (@BrandingBrandi) February 26, 2019

Georgetown law professor Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that when EPIC filed complaints with the FTC to block Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 and Nest in 2014, Google’s response was to pump money into universities, think tanks, and nongovernmental groups. “Money buys silence,” Rotenberg says. “Google doesn’t need the experts to agree with them. They only need them to look the other way.”

Experts who defend tech companies in Washington generally say they are not influenced by Google’s donations. Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, a left-leaning think tank that favors tough antitrust enforcement, finds that curious. “It’s funny that economists think that incentives work on everybody but economists,” Stoller says.

Bribery charges against Thomas Moyer, Apple’s global head of security, were dismissed Tuesday by the judge in the case, who cited a lack of evidence. Moyer had been accused in November of offering the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office a donation of iPads in exchange for concealed-weapons permits. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight But California Superior Court Judge Eric S. Geffon said in an order Tuesday that the grand jury “could not have reasonably concluded that Moyer had a corrupt intent” because Moyer did not act “wrongfully to gain an advantage.”

Moyer had been taking a leave of absence from his job at Apple, according to his attorney, Ed Swanson, and plans to resume work in the same role at the company following his exoneration. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We believe that the criminal grand jury — the 19 citizens who heard direct evidence and from witnesses in this public corruption case — correctly indicted Mr. Moyer for bribery. We stand by the grand jury’s decision and are evaluating our options,” Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in an emailed statement.

The charges were part of a broader, two-year investigation into the sheriff’s office that explored an alleged scheme to trade concealed-weapons permits in exchange for goods, such as iPads and expensive sports tickets. Charges against two officials from the sheriff’s office are still pending.

Mary McNamara, who led Moyer’s defense with Swanson, said in an interview Tuesday that the decision to throw the case out was very rare. She said it’s common for defense attorneys to file motions to dismiss criminal charges brought by prosecutors, but judges don’t often grant them, instead allowing a jury to decide the defendant’s fate. It’s “rarer still to have them memorialized in an opinion and even more rare to have an analysis that is 17 pages,” she said, referring to the judge’s order issued Tuesday.

On Feb. 8, 2019, Moyer met with officials from the sheriff’s office to discuss “sensitive” issues, according to court records. During the meeting, Moyer sent himself an email with the subject line “iPad Donation” and no text. Soon after the meeting, Moyer arranged for iPads to be donated to the sheriff’s office, according to court documents. The next month, Apple received concealed-weapons permits for its security staff.

Prosecutors said the Feb. 8 meeting was held to discuss a bribe: The iPad donations in exchange for the permits.

But Geffon called that accusation “pure speculation” that was “not supported by evidence presented to the grand jury.” Geffon noted that the sheriff’s office had verbally confirmed the permits would be issued as far back as June 2018.

“There is simply no evidence that suddenly, on February 8, 2019, Moyer was told or believed that the [concealed-weapons] permits would not be issued or released to the executive protection team unless the Sheriff’s Office received something in exchange (such as a donation of iPads),” he wrote.

Emily Farnworth, Global Director of Low Carbon Economy Transition at ERM, spoke with Michael Terrell, Head of Energy Market Strategy at Google. Michael leads the global energy market strategy and 24/7 carbon-free energy initiatives for Google’s data centers and global energy portfolio.

Emily Farnworth: What does your carbon-free energy goal mean to you?

Michael Terrell: Google’s carbon footprint has historically been most associated with electricity consumption in our data centers. Along the way, Google has undertaken commitments related to energy consumption and how we could improve it. In our data centers, we set a 100 percent renewable energy goal in 2012. We achieved it in 2017 and have every year since – but that is not our end goal.

Our end goal is complete decarbonization of our electricity consumption. In September 2020, Google announced a commitment to reach 24/7 carbon-free energy for our data centers and office campuses around the world by 2030.

The development of our 24/7 carbon-free energy goal was based on a decade of work and experience that built confidence in our ability to scale up clean energy across our company and achieve increasingly ambitious aspirations.

We are also working across our supply chain where we have committed to enable 5 GW of new clean energy deployment in key manufacturing regions.

What was the start of your decarbonization journey?

When we set our 100 percent renewable energy commitment, it was considered cutting edge given how difficult it was to buy renewable electricity at scale at that time. Now we have 5,500 MWs under agreement for data centers around the world.

In the early days, we found that carbon offsets were the main way to address our footprint. We knew this wasn’t a long term solution and looked for ways to purchase renewable energy directly. We signed our first wind power purchase agreement in 2010 and more followed. This helped us feel confident in setting a 100 percent renewable target.

On our current journey, Google is riding the wave of technology and innovations. We are seeing new policy developments for states and regions for new clean energy targets, with the expectation for the grid to ‘get cleaner’ over the next decade as well.

What were the primary drivers for setting your 24/7 carbon-free energy goal? How have you balanced your growth with your decarbonization ambitions?

We recognized that our operations have an environmental impact, and we wanted to find the best way we could mitigate or minimize this impact.

We are also lucky in that Google has strong employee and leadership commitments to address these issues, and the company has not been afraid to invest resources in employee time and effort, or to make financial commitments towards achieving our net zero goals.

Historically, Google has grown roughly 20 percent on average year over year. This factors into how we set future targets. We have developed experience scaling renewables, which enables us to achieve ambitious targets, even with the growth we are experiencing.

Currently we have data centers in about 21 markets around the world, and we are expecting to be in more by 2030.

Our 24/7 carbon-free target was based on more than a decade of work and experience that led us to believe that we can take on this carbon-free energy goal.

What key challenges have you experienced so far?

Existing policy structures in many of the electricity markets in which we operate have made achieving our clean energy goals difficult.

Rather than working within these structures, in some places we have looked to partner with utilities and governments to develop policies that provide access for all companies to buy clean energy and strengthen the market for clean energy more generally.

We have worked with others to change policy to create pathways for direct purchases in places like North Carolina and Georgia in the US. In Taiwan, Google worked with the government to amend the Electricity Act to allow corporations to purchase clean energy, which led to Google signing the first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in the country.

Changing policy takes time, but when you do it, it leads to broader change beyond just one company. One advantage of working with other companies through groups like REBA, Re-Source, and RE100 on a global scale is to drive change in the market and to let policy makers know there is very strong demand for corporates to tackle the problem to gain access to clean energy.

We also know that new technology approaches will be needed to run our facilities on 24/7 carbon-free energy, and we are evaluating how different technologies - including variable renewables, energy storage, and firm carbon-free energy technologies - can work together to help achieve our goals.

What is your advice to other companies that are currently going through this process?

Policy has been a big challenge, but the business case for clean energy has never been stronger. Clean energy today makes financial sense with fixed-price contracts.

Achieving internal buy-in by walking through the business and societal advantages that come with clean energy has been critical to translating our goals into concrete actions.

Realizing clean energy goals requires following your internal processes, taking your goals to leaders, finance, and operations, and walking them through the benefits and advantages. Getting buy-in from operations and finance was critical to quickly scaling up and doing deals for clean energy. We didn’t treat the initiative like a one-off, it was more like ‘This is how we are going to source power, how we will run the business, and these are our goals’.

What are good practices for getting beyond barriers?

Focus on what is unique about your footprint and find like-minded partners. Then help them to achieve their goals and develop the deeper solutions which lead to transformational change.

With climate change progressing and the need for a carbon-free economy becoming ever more pressing, we know we need to be taking even more aggressive action. Today, companies need to find their market niche and go big, focusing on transforming the energy system rather than following it.

We now need to look fundamentally at how we can drive to a carbon-free economy. Every company touches the economy in a certain way. If every company doubled down and went big, then we will be able to drive transformational change.

Google wants to work with partners who have similar problems. By working collaboratively with others in similar situations, we can better drive solutions and holistic change.

What do you think will be the broader challenges ahead on your journey to achieving net zero?

We have a long way to go on our journey to 24/7 carbon-free energy. We need to see stronger policies that support climate goals and promote a cleaner economy. There tends to be a focus on carbon policy, but energy policy is just as important given how it helps to structure markets and send signals.

If every sector steps up to the challenge, we will see new opportunities. Each sector needs to drill down to fundamental differentiators to determine what it should do to help drive systemic transformational change.

Companies must look at all parts of their operations to find areas to make a big impact. I feel that if Google doesn’t eventually drive change that’s 1000 times or more greater than our own carbon footprint, then we have failed.

So far Google has mostly been focused on our own electricity use and data centers; yet the way we touch and empower users may very well be our next big frontier."
7,"The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EV) alone isn't what charged Tesla's revenue generation last year. In fact, carbon credit sales jumped, giving the automaker a boost while also highlighting the potential growth opportunities in the carbon credit market.

According to a Carbon Credits article, carbon credit sales have been a revenue generator for Tesla for the past eight business quarters. The electric automaker sells carbon credits to the other automotive manufacturers, giving them the ability to continue operations if they don't meet emissions standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

2022 was a difficult year for not only the markets, but for the economy in general. With consumers pinching their pennies amid rising inflation, one of the last purchases on their minds was probably a new car.

As such, selling carbon credits was probably a good hedge for Tesla if automotive sales were lagging last year. It's a strategic move, allowing for the company to draw revenue from other sources aside from selling vehicles.

""Tesla’s carbon credit sales are making headlines again as it reached a new record in 2022,"" the article noted. ""The company reported that Q4 carbon credit sales jumped 47% year over year.""

Investing in California's Carbon Credit Market

Tesla's revenue generation model, particularly with respect to meeting emissions standards in a strict California regulatory framework, highlights opportunities in the carbon credit market. With California aggressively pushing to reduce its carbon output, investors will want to look at state-specific opportunities in the state that can capitalize on this initiative.

One such opportunity to consider is the KraneShares California Carbon Allowance ETF (KCCA). The fund provides targeted exposure to the California Carbon Allowances (CCA) cap-and-trade carbon allowance program.

KCCA is benchmarked to the IHS Markit Carbon CCA Index, which tracks the frequently traded CCA futures contracts. The fund is a part of the KraneShares suite of carbon ETFs and provides exposure to an investment vehicle that capitalizes on the price of carbon and hedges risk while supporting goals aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives.

The index measures a portfolio of futures contracts on carbon credits issued by the CCA and only includes futures with a maturity in December in the next year or two while using a wholly owned subsidiary in the Cayman Islands to prevent investors from needing a K-1 for tax purposes. Furthermore, CCA provides investors with portfolio diversification with exposure to assets that don’t typically correlate to the broader stock market.

8,"What is the moral of this story? The industry has figured out the fundamentals. Soon, the focus of a new bike purchase will gravitate to finding the best match between riding style and machine. A dazzling descender may be the perfect choice for a rider who lives in Finale Ligure or Whistler, but that's not most of us. Unless you plan on racing, a bike like the Santa Cruz Megatower eliminates almost every reason to own a dual-crown downhill bike. Liteville's 301 Enduro erases the reasons for most of us to own a Megatower - and it'll make you question why you'd want a short-travel mountain bike as well.



Value will weigh more heavily in our purchases. Bike designs have stabilized, so we'll be keeping them longer. Once you've made the right choice, you're going to want it to be hassle free for a long time. Liteville's 301 MK15 Enduro shows us that getting it right is only the first step. The journey is then perfecting it. Therein lies the larger portion of the value equation. Recall the products you value most and it's likely that they are the ones you reach for most often, have steadfastly performed and have withstood the test of time.



I still have that first Liteville 301 MK10 we reviewed eight years ago. It's been my primary ride, a test-product mule, a loaner bike, and now I ride it occasionally as a reminder that I was an idiot to preach that 26-inch wheels were the better option for a mountain bike. Jokes aside, that Liteville still rides like new - no creaks, no wiggly pivots. It's a small marvel, and I have no doubt that the Mark 15 that is in my stable today will be busting out laps somewhere in the mountains long after I'm subjugated to driving around the supermarket in an electric mobility cart. — RC"
9,"A majority (up to 85%) of the emissions from a barrel of oil come when transportation, such as your car, is driven, according to Carbon Tracker. It's a stark example of how difficult the net-zero goal will be for companies, but far from the only one. Red Huber | Tribune News Service | Getty Images

Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is moving the market regulator closer to requiring carbon disclosures from companies as investor concerns about the material impact of climate change on financial performance continue to escalate. Major companies, including Apple, are on board. Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, who is a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, backed a comprehensive carbon disclosure requirement in April. But in Gensler's recent outline of his thinking on how to go about mandating carbon disclosure, he made an important caveat: The SEC may still opt to not include Scope 3 emissions in any forthcoming regulation. That's an indication of just how hard it is for companies to track all Scope 3 emissions, the greenhouse gas emissions of other companies in a company's value chain. But it is also an admission that if it's ""code red for humanity"" in slowing climate change, the corporate world has not come nearly far enough in recent decades in figuring out how to track carbon emissions through the entire supply chain. And that is a point of frustration for climate experts who have been working on science-based carbon targets, tracking and accounting for decades. In a speech he gave in late July, Gensler noted that some companies currently provide voluntary disclosures related to what's called Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions from a company's operations, owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 refers to how corporations measure indirect emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat and cooling. But Gensler noted many investors are looking for information beyond Scope 1 and Scope 2, to Scope 3. ""Thus, I've asked staff to make recommendations about how companies might disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, along with whether to disclose Scope 3 emissions — and if so, how and under what circumstances,"" the SEC chair said.

Majority of industrial carbon emissions are Scope 3

That ""whether to disclose"" looms large because the majority of carbon emissions from industrial sources don't occur in Scope 1 and Scope 2 but in the Scope 3 emissions furthest away from a company's operations. Carbon Trust research shows that for most companies, Scope 3 emissions represent from 65% to 95% of a company's broader carbon impact. But it would put the SEC in line with the existing GHG Protocol — which provides tools for businesses to track and calculate emissions and advises all organizations to quantify Scope 1 and 2 emissions when reporting and disclosing GHG emissions. It says Scope 3 emissions quantification is ""optional"" even though it notes that Scope 3 emission sources may represent the majority of an organization's GHG emissions. Being the largest source of emissions means Scope 3 is also the broadest opportunity for carbon reduction. And it implies that as more companies set ambitious targets for carbon reduction and the ""net zero"" goals in the decades ahead, there will be no way to hold them accountable if Scope 3 tracking and disclosure does not improve. ""Companies will eventually be held accountable for these targets, and they usually include Scope 3, so this has to be solved,"" said Cynthia Cummis, director of private sector climate mitigation for the World Resources Institute. Other climate experts are even less confident. ""They are not ready for this,"" said Angel Hsu, assistant professor of public policy and the Environment, Ecology and Energy Program at the University of North Carolina and founder of the Data-Driven EnviroLab. ""It is frustrating and surprising,"" said Hsu, who worked on the GHG Protocol. ""If companies are not reporting Scope 3 they are missing a huge part.""

Apple and Exxon and carbon reduction

Many companies are reporting to the level of Scope 3 already, and the standard has been available for roughly a decade. According to investor sustainability advocate Ceres, over 3,000 companies have reported Scope 3 under the Carbon Disclosure Project. Apple 's embrace of emissions reporting would include Scope 3, according to the company, though the statement was not explicit. ExxonMobil released Scope 3 emissions for the first time in 2021 but noted that the data ""is less certain and less consistent because it includes the indirect emissions resulting from the consumption and use of a company's products occurring outside of its control."" In disclosing the number — 540 million tonnes of CO2 from upstream production, to be exact — the oil giant took multiple digs at the accounting, also stating that ""Scope 3 emissions do not provide meaningful insight into the company's emission-reduction performance and could be misleading in some respects.""

watch now

Some companies also have begun to develop their own approaches to Scope 3, and behind the scenes they have questioned the approach from the ""academics and NGOs"" that developed the original methods, which companies worry could force them to push supply chain partners to change, rather than work in coordination to reduce their carbon footprint. Climate advocates such as Ceres aren't buying that but say there is more work to be done across the many companies that don't report on Scope 3 yet. ""It does involve emissions outside of the control of a company in the supply chain and does require engagement with suppliers,"" said Steven Clarke, director of corporate clean energy leadership at Ceres. ""And we do know suppliers, particularly small and medium-sized ones, are overwhelmed by requests from bigger partners."" One example is industrial giant Honeywell, which earlier this year announced its own Scope 3 carbon accounting and coordination project for its supply chain. The company also noted the effort provides an opportunity for it to sell its own energy efficiency products to the supply chain. Ceres officials say the corporate-led approach is becoming more common and not just within one company's supply chain but among competitors, too. That has led to things like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, with companies within a sector coming together on Scope 3 targets. They are acknowledging they don't know how to meet the requirements today, but since they all use the same contract manufacturers and logistics providers it makes sense to come together to develop technology and engage suppliers so they are not overburdened with surveys and questions. ""We are getting good ambitious commitments, but the realty is Scope 3 is a challenging area to measure and that puts people off,"" said Tom Cumberlege, who leads Carbon Trust's work on value chains. ""What Scope 3 really means as far as a main effort is the gap between pledges and calculation. Once it is measured, we're only at the starting line of action."" ""Retailers say they desperately need to figure out science-based targets, that customers are demanding it,"" he said. ""It is definitely there and significant in the marketplace.""

Net zero can't happen without changed supply chains

The efforts are increasing across sectors, too, with coalitions such as Transform to Net Zero, in which Microsoft and Starbucks were among the companies that came together in 2020, and the Amazon-led Climate Pledge. ""The data is still hard to 'wrap their heads around' for many companies,"" Clarke said, but ""if you want to thrive in a decarbonized future, you need to address it."" Cummis noted it's not as if a ton of work hasn't been done already. There are 600 valid Scope 3 targets aligned with the GHG Protocol — she was part of the team that developed them. She is most frustrated that there is still an imbalance between the data and the demand, and it is one that has to be fixed for the carbon reduction targets that companies are issuing to be verified. ""We assumed 10 years ago we were creating demand for high transparency data and supply chains, and the companies would be willing to pay for the data, and data providers would generate it, or trade groups,"" she said. While the action is picking up, from tech giants such as SAP to start-ups such as Persefoni, so far, Cummis said, third-party databases offering broad estimates for sectors and kinds of businesses are more common. ""It is fine to get an estimate to understand a relative proportion of emissions by activity, but now we have targets and we have to track progress, and it is hard to use average emissions databases for that.""

You don't even know if you're on a path to net zero without better data. Cynthia Cummis, director of private sector climate mitigation for the World Resources Institute

It is not a surprise to the climate experts that some companies are trying to figure out the best way to tackle Scope 3 on their own, and companies such as Apple and Amazon and its Climate Pledge may be up to the challenge, but that also runs the risk of falling short of the collective action that will be required. ""Amazon wanting to lead on this would be great, because they cover so many product categories,"" Cummis said. ""But whatever they develop needs to be fully open source so others can have access to the data as well. It will be a higher quality tool that's more usable if it's developed in partnership with other companies in the value chain and not just at the retailer level.""

Food, energy emissions climate challenges

The challenges food companies face are a good example. Their biggest emissions sources come from primary suppliers such as farms where it is difficult to get data, and so they may not know what farms are buying and how to trace those inputs, especially when it comes to commodities. In work it did with the GHG Protocol, Kraft found that 90% of its emissions were from the supply chain and at the Scope 3 level. ""If there were tools to support them, that would be helpful,"" Cummis said, ""but the farmers need more incentives, and there are many middlemen in there too if they are buying commodities. It's not buying direct."" The oil and gas sector is one of the more stark examples of the Scope 3 issue. According to Mike Coffin, oil and gas analyst at Carbon Tracker, 85% of the emissions from a barrel of oil come when transportation, such as your car, is driven. When you look at a company like ExxonMobil, Scope 1 and Scope 2 together are a minority of total emissions. ""We really look at it from that lens, and upstream oil and gas companies, whatever targets they do, need to be done on an absolute basis rather than intensity of operations basis,"" he said. Companies from ExxonMobil to Royal Dutch Shell can reduce emissions intensity by adding renewables — which is becoming a bigger part of their climate strategy — or low carbon to the mix, but they are still providing the same amount of CO2 emissions. ""We think it's crucial that any goals have an absolute basis rather than just intensity basis, but getting their heads around that means producing less of their core product,"" Coffin said. Occidental , seen as an early leader among U.S.-based oil and gas companies on carbon strategy, is still going to fall far short of the mark unless its most ambitious carbon capture technologies are proven. ""Say Oxy reduces emissions intensity by 50%, it's still just 50% of that 15% that is Scope 1 and does nothing for the 85%,"" Coffin said. ""The planet doesn't care about how much energy is used but [about] reducing CO2, and that's why it is critical to have absolute targets."" BP has said it will reduce emissions on an absolute basis, and that can only mean one thing: producing less oil and gas. ""That's what we need,"" Coffin said. ""Reducing Scope 3 for them is moving away from being an oil and gas producer, and it's really the only option they have, just become smaller or do something else in renewables, or whatever. It doesn't matter, maybe give money back to shareholders.""

The clock is ticking

Where the corporate world stands today in terms of carbon emissions disclosure is pretty simple. Scope 1 and Scope 2 a company must know. How much refrigerant it is buying and the electricity it is using, which they get a bill for every month, is the easy part. Scope 3 remains complicated, but it could be solved faster if there were more effort. ""It's a solvable problem,"" Cummis said. But so far, even if more players, and some of the right players, are stepping up they haven't stepped forward fast enough. ""For too long we've said if the Apples, Walmarts and Amazons support this it will happen,"" she said. ""We've made great progress in getting companies to measure Scope 3 and set science-based targets, but there is a big gap in data quality."" Even if the net zero targets are laid out over decades, the clock is ticking today. The real crunch time, according to Cumberlege, will come in the decade between 2030 and 2040, the net-zero goal for many companies. But that timeline makes him critical of what they are doing today to ""realistically and programmatically"" tackle the data challenge. ""Lots of companies have spent lots of effort collecting data and setting targets,"" Cumberlege said. ""But they are really only at the start of the race in terms of the effort needed on how data informs the decision-making and what the business would look like in a net-zero world and how to transform the supply chain to fit with that."" The near-term science-based targets need to be measured over a 5- to 15-year timespan, not 20 to 25 years, for companies to be on a path to net zero. ""But you don't even know if you're on a path to net zero without better data,"" Cummis said. Hsu said she is encouraged by the fact that the companies now reporting on Scope 3 are no longer the extreme exception to the rule. But the fact that most companies do not mention Scope 3 explicitly in net-zero commitments and the fact that the total number of companies reporting Scope 3 is ""nowhere near complete"" leave her concluding carbon disclosure will remain an area of major uncertainty. Research in recent years from the Carbon Disclosure Project on companies reporting Scope 3 showed that even among this group, the data covered less than one-quarter of Scope 3 emissions. Andrew Behar, a shareholder advocate and CEO of As You Sow, which has long led climate disclosure efforts among investors pressuring companies, and who is involved in the Say on Climate initiative, says using the 2050 net-zero target as an example — which is the timeline for many companies — means a net 50% reduction by 2030, because once the low-hanging fruit is taken care of, the percentage goals get harder to reach. ""That means 5% every year for the next 10 years, and it means Scope 3, and they need to actually report that."" But he does see the message getting through at some big companies. A recent vote at GE to require net-zero goals and Scope 3 emissions on products including traditional power generation, jet engines and wind turbines received 98% support, and the company announced last month it is moving forward with the plan. ""It's real, and they are going to do it,"" Behar said. There is a chicken-or-egg issue among the broader set of companies in the slow pace of progress, which is part of what makes it challenging to solve. ""Part of the problem is we can't expect all the companies to follow through until all the data is available, and we can't get all the data until more companies disclose,"" Hsu said."

Their optimism, unique view of the world, and relentless energy are refreshing, and Google tapped into that with its Doodle 4 Google contest, which was won this year by an 11-year-old.“For our 7th annual Doodle 4 Google competition, we asked kids, grades K-12, to draw an invention that would make the world a better place,” reads the contest page. “Out of more than 100,000 submissions, 250 state finalists, 50 state winners, and 5 national age group winners, we are excited to present the 2014 Doodle 4 Google winner: 11-year old Audrey Zhang of New York!”Audrey’s drawing was of a “transformative water purifier” that would quickly process dirty or polluted water from rivers, lakes, and oceans, and convert it into clean drinking water.

11,"OPINION:

While we’ve been watching far more television than normal, we’ve gotten a larger dose of appeals for money. And I’m not talking about pillows or weight loss programs. I’m referring to the heartbreaking appeals from charities. In 2019, Americans donated a combined $450 billion to charitable causes. But not all charities are created equal. Some organizations pour large sums of their budget into executive salaries, circular fundraising expenses, big offices and extravagant overhead costs.

Nearly every category of charity has good and bad actors, but causes with an emotional fundraising approach attract the lion’s share. Organizations that claim to protect animals or help returning or injured soldiers are prime examples where some organizations fail to deliver on implied promises.

The Wounded Warriors Project (WWP) is a charity that seemingly provides assistance to wounded veterans. But a deeper dive into the organization’s financials reveals a darker side. According to the latest data from CharityWatch, WWP only spends 64% of its budget to provide programmed help to veterans. And the help it offers is often more modest than you suspect. With a little bit of research you’ll find program services include “greeting [veterans] at the airport,” “spreading the word about [wounded veteran] needs” and coordinating “physical activity sessions.” Interesting, but hardly what the commercial imagery suggests your money will provide.

Much of the budget is bogged down in executive pay — which can top $300,000 — office expenses, fundraising schemes and other administrative costs. A 2016 CBS News investigation previously outed WWP — citing 40 former charity employees who described the spending as “out of control.” The report detailed how staff dined at “fancy restaurants” and stayed at “lavish hotels.” One destination staff retreat in Colorado cost the organization roughly $3 million.

While that report was seen by many, the WWP continues to advertise its value, which crowds out better groups that have less money to spend on commercials. Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is another bad apple charity. Given a D rating by CharityWatch, the group spends 51 cents of every dollar on activities to help disabled veterans.

Conversely, other veteran and military groups — including the Semper Fi Fund, Fisher House Foundation and Homes for Our Troops — receive “A”-ratings.

On the animal care side, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) — which polling indicates is a name that is confused with local shelters, actually does shelter money. Its last tax return shows more than $35 million is sheltered in offshore accounts. The organization spends roughly 1% of its budget in grants to local animal shelters. Historically, more has been invested in pension plans each year than caring for shelter animals. Donations would go to much better use at, for example, American Humane — which enjoys an A grade from CharityWatch (disclosure: I have supported their work).

Redirecting donations that typically fund C-, D- or F-rated charities to groups that spend budgets more wisely is a win-win. More than 50 veteran and animal groups received poor ratings from CharityWatch in 2020 — organizations that in some cases rake in hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Donations funding great jobs and perks while shortchanging the intended beneficiaries is money that needs to be redirected. (For example, the head of the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) gets paid more than $800,000 annually while running one shelter.)

Imagine how much more help would be afforded those in need by redirecting all the donations to A- and B-rated groups. Cautionary note: For those who want to do their homework before giving, go to charitywatch.org. The Better Business Bureau and Charity Navigator ratings are not reliable for varying reasons.

The news that Hertz would be buying 100,000 Tesla cars catapulted the company’s market value to $1 trillion. Add in the fact that last month the Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling car in Europe, it seems clear that a tipping point has been passed.

You could say Elon Musk has been given his reward for services to environmental issues, for he has pretty much single-handedly transformed the global motor fleet from internal combustion engines to electric ones. Or you might equally say that it shows the absurdly high valuations now put on US technology companies, for eight of the top 10 wealthiest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, are American technology billionaires.

In some cases, the head unit indicated Android Auto needed to reconnect, eventually pushing the whole thing into an infinite loop.The glitch was rapidly confirmed by many other users, and since then, the thread posted on Google’s forum gained no less than 600 “me too” upvotes, obviously as the problem wasn’t encountered on just a small number of devices.Google, however, moved pretty fast this time, so in late August, the company came up with a fix. “It may take a few days for the fix to reach everyone,” a Community Specialist said on August 26, explaining that everything should be back to normal for all users in approximately one week.It’s November, and here we are with lots of users still unable to run Android Auto because of the very same problem caused by an app update shipped in the summer.The fix released by Google fixed, well, nothing, as users explain on the forums that they’re hitting pretty much the same glitch as they did a couple of months ago. This happens on up-to-date devices where the latest versions of all apps are installed.At this point, however, there’s absolutely no word on a new potential fix, and Google’s Community Specialists have so far remained tight-lipped on the status of the investigation."

EFF MP Kicked Out of National Assembly For Calling President Ramaphosa a 'Money Launderer, Thief

EFF MP Natasha Ntlangwini was kicked out of the National Assembly after calling President Cyril Ramaphosa a ""money launder and a thief"".

According to reports, the MP said toward the end of her contribution in the debate on Parliament's budget: ""Mr Cyril Ramaphosa must step down, he is a money launderer and a criminal. ""He will never have peace in this house."" Meanwhile EFF leader Julius Malema has added his voice to the call for the president to step aside while the SA Police Services investigate the theft of over U.S.$4 billion from his game farm in Limpopo, which was never reported.

So What Were You Asking Google Search In Month of May?

While many South Africans searched for more information on big sporting events, national holidays and events impacting the economy based on Google search activity in May. Among the most pressing for cash strapped South Africans was the increase in the repo rate to 4.75%, while Monkeypox cases worldwide also piqued interest. High profile deaths like those of Hillary Gardee, daughter of former EFF Secretary-General Godrich Gardee who was found murdered, the death of Johannesburg mayor Mpho Moerane after a car accident and the death of actor Siyabonga Zubane also caused a frenzy. Questions on Mother's Day and Father's Day dates, as well as what Africa Day on May 25 is about were also asked.

Gupta Brothers Arrested in Dubai - NPA Needs Watertight Case to Extradite

The Gupta brothers, Atul and Rajesh, have been arrested in Dubai. The National Prosecuting Authority needs to work on ensuring their extradition to South Africa to face trial on the looting of State coffers, better known as State capture. The brothers have evaded any arrest until now. The depths at which State capture weakened South Africa's economy was first exposed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in her report which implicated the Guptas together with their close friend, former president Jacob Zuma. Revelations at the Zondo Commission of Enquiry further revealed how various State entities like Eskom, Transnet and others were used for the purpose of enriching the Gupta family.

Things Up In the Air After Comair Grounds Planes

A cash crunch at Comair and their grounding of Kulula and British Airways flights, operated under licence, has seen a 40% cut in domestic seat capacity. While other airlines are adding flights to their rosters, filling the gap by finding additional aircraft, pilots and cabin crew will take time. The Competition Commission has also warned against price gauging by airlines on ticket sales during this time.

Health Minister Calls for Calm as Measles Cases Emerge in Gauteng

Health Minister Joe Phalla is calling for calm after four cases of measles - three in Tshwane and one on the west rand, were detected. Health authorities in the area are working to identify and vaccinate all contacts. There has been a global increase of 79% of measles cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that is caused by a virus which mainly spreads through infectious airborne respiratory droplets from infected persons when coughing or sneezing, the minister said."
16,"Charges that a former Apple manager and an associate collected more than $2.5 million in kickbacks from six Asian suppliers underscore the challenges Silicon Valley companies face in monitoring the behavior of employees cutting deals far from headquarters, experts say.

Silicon Valley companies, from startups to giant multinationals, regularly navigate a culture of corruption in emerging markets, say anti-corruption experts and those who do business overseas. In countries where under-the-table deals are more commonplace, it can be tempting for employees representing tech giants to engage in such behavior, not only for their direct benefit but “to be seen as productive in the eyes of their companies,” said Richard Bernes, the former supervisor of the FBI’s high-tech squad in San Jose.

Jack Jia, chief executive of Baynote, a San Jose startup that makes search software and has operations in China, said he was once forced to pay a Taiwanese broker a “fee” simply to get access to clients when he represented another software company.

While the business climate in emerging markets is improving, kickbacks are not unusual, he said.

“It used to be this happened and no one paid attention or cared about it,” Jia said. “But Apple is in the spotlight.”

Paul Shim Devine, 37, of Sunnyvale, pleaded not guilty Monday to allegations that he and an accomplice ran a complex scheme of providing confidential product information to suppliers in return for payments based on a percentage of the business the companies did with Apple. A bail hearing is scheduled for today in federal court in San Jose. Federal authorities have not commented on the whereabouts of Devine’s alleged co-conspirator, Andrew Ang of Singapore.

Devine, who worked for Apple from 2005 until recently and earned $665,000 in salary and bonuses in that period, was responsible for selecting suppliers of parts for Apple’s iPhone and iPod headsets.

A manager representing a company such as Apple “is in a position of power,” said Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White. “He’s got the hottest product on the market. The suppliers are very hungry to work with a company like this. You could see a situation where someone in a position of power could take advantage of that.”

In a racketeering lawsuit filed last week, Apple said it uncovered e-mails on the company laptop he used that “confirmed Devine had demanded and received over a million dollars in illicit payments, kickbacks, bribes and other things of value … from numerous suppliers, and had concealed his scheme from Apple over the course of several years.”

It is unclear what initially piqued Apple’s suspicions and led the Cupertino company to begin investigating Devine in April.

Often, a supplier who feels it is competing at a disadvantage flags a company like Apple that something is amiss, experts say. The whistle-blower also could be a fellow employee who gets wind of corporate shenanigans and notifies management. Or an employee involved in unsavory actions could inadvertently draw attention to himself by living beyond his means — such as showing up to work in a new Porsche.

Apple, which aggressively protects product secrecy, “is taking a scorched-earth policy” toward its former employee, said Lee Altschuler, who formerly headed up the Silicon Valley branch of the U.S. attorney’s office. “What Apple is saying to its employees is, ‘We are not afraid to send a message to the rank and file’ ” that such alleged violations will not be tolerated.

Security experts say preventing employee corruption requires a determined effort by companies, including strong policies and systems that can spot irregularities, such as close audits of expenditures. However, internal policing is a delicate process in Silicon Valley, whose business culture favors the independence and loyalty of employees.

“It’s expensive for companies to micromanage employees,” Altschuler said. “It speaks volumes about a corporate culture when a company has to micromanage employees. Does the company trust its people?”

Companies that can maintain good morale in their cubicles are less vulnerable to employee fraud, Altschuler said: “Historically, disgruntled employees are the ones more likely to lie, cheat and steal.”

Even without sophisticated computer searches, companies can be vigilant against bribes and kickbacks, according to former FBI supervisor Bernes, who now works as a security consultant.

New employees who will be in sensitive positions should be screened before joining the company, he said, adding that he once was hired to check on prospective administrative assistants, such as a CEO’s secretary, who are privy to sensitive corporate information. His research included speaking with neighbors of job candidates.

“I’m not advocating every company do that,” Bernes said. “But they should do some degree of background checks.”

In the end, however, there is no way a company can ensure corporate crime never occurs.

“You can’t solve greed completely,” Bernes said. “You can just try.”

Cleveland, Ohio based Electronic Merchant Systems (EMS) is offering credit card processing for grocery stores across the United States. Since 1988, the leading provider of payment processing and merchant services has been helping business owners realize their full potential and develop their financial health.

A representative for Electronic Merchant Systems says, “Grocery stores are an essential part of modern life, and they play a critical role in maintaining the health and well-being of communities across the country. They provide a convenient and accessible way for people to purchase the food and household items they need while helping support local farmers and producers. More than that, grocery stores can also serve as community hubs, offering services such as deli counters, bakeries, and even pharmacies.”

The representative continues, “With how important grocery stores can be, owners have a lot of balls to juggle — Electronic Merchant Systems’ payment processing platforms are meant to take a little bit of the burden off grocery store owners so they can focus on satisfying their customers and make sure they enjoy themselves.”

Electronic Merchant Systems works in concert with small businesses across the country to provide the right payment solutions that help them succeed. For grocery stores, the company offers a range of great point-of-sale (POS) systems, mobile payment processing solutions, and fully customizable gift cards, all of which can enhance a store’s appeal and help them succeed as a core aspect of their respective communities.

With the advanced MaxxPay® Pro technology on offer from Electronic Merchant Systems, grocery store owners stand to gain many benefits.

I have had to call the help desk twice, and they have been very helpful and answered my questions both times with no issues. The gentleman that signed us up for the system was so kind and helpful. I do not regret switching at all!”

Rashaad S. says in another review, “I’m truly grateful for this platform. The assistance that Mike took with me made me feel important and valuable. He was patient and completely professional. As someone who doesn’t write many reviews, I had to write this one. Ask for Mike, he won’t let you down. Thanks, my friend! Mike and EMS are the best!”

This article was published on Dividend Kings on Tuesday, December 20th.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safe dividends are one of my greatest passions. That's because dividend growth stocks are historically the best way to generate passive income and life-changing wealth.

Legacy Research

Over the last five years, dividend growth stocks have delivered 7X more inflation-adjusted wealth than non-dividend stocks.

The Dividend Kings 500 Master List includes some of the world's best companies, including:

every dividend champion (25+ year dividend growth streaks, including foreign aristocrats)

every dividend aristocrat

every dividend king (50+ year dividend growth streaks)

every Ultra SWAN (as close to perfect quality companies as exist)

the 20% highest quality REITs according to iREIT

40 of the world's best growth blue-chips.

One of the growth stocks we cover is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which basically kickstarted the electric vehicle (""EV"") revolution by making electric cars cool and desirable.

Several Dividend Kings members asked me for an update on Tesla, which is suffering its worst bear market in history.

Ycharts

Many reasons have contributed to Tesla's plunge:

FAST Graphs, FactSet

For one thing, during the Pandemic bubble, Tesla's valuation became absurd, with at 30X sales. Not even God's own company is worth those kinds of absurd valuations.

Tesla was priced as if nothing ever bad would happen again, and of course, something always does.

soaring interest rates

a bear market

a recession

Chinese lockdowns hurting demand

concerns that a recession will reduce global demand

Elon Musk's insane misadventures with Twitter forced him to sell $23 billion worth of Tesla stock at crashing prices.

Well, interest rates aren't coming down, the bear market isn't over, and the recession isn't likely to start until Q1 of 2023. But at least one major headwind for Tesla appears to be ending.

On Sunday, Musk posted a poll on Twitter asking if he should step down as CEO and said he'd honor it. After almost 18 million votes, 58% said he should resign.

Whether or not he does is another story, but he now has the cover to potentially stop wasting his valuable time on the biggest mistake of his life.

So does this mean that Tesla has bottomed? If Twitter's distraction were the only reason for the stock crash, then probably. But Tesla still faces a lot of headwinds, including a rather bleak short-term market outlook.

S&P Potential Bear Market Bottom

Earnings Decline In 2023 2023 S&P Earnings X 25-Year Average PE Of 16.7 Decline From Current Level 0% $218.45 $3,648.12 5.3% 5% $207.53 $3,465.71 10.0% 10% $196.61 $3,283.30 14.8% 13% $190.05 $3,173.86 17.6% 15% $185.68 $3,100.90 19.5% 20% $174.76 $2,918.49 24.2% Click to enlarge

(Source: DK S&P Valuation Tool, FactSet, Bloomberg)

Even if economists are right and the coming recession is the mildest in history, and earnings decline by a fraction of their historical norm, stocks are likely to fall before they bottom.

Tesla's historical volatility is 177% that of the S&P.

So does that mean anyone buying Tesla today is being foolish? Is Tesla destined to fall by 9% to 43% more before it bottoms for good?

Not necessarily. It's always a market of stocks, not a stock market. Consider that Amazon (AMZN) bottomed in January 2002, 10 months before the S&P did. In fact, Amazon was up about 70% by October 2002, when the S&P finally stopped crashing.

YCharts

Netflix (NFLX) is an example of a tech stock that might have already bottomed, even with the worst yet to come for the S&P.

It was down 75% off its peak and is up 70% off its mid-2022 lows.

the October 13th S&P low didn't cause Netflix to fall to new lows

neither did news that it had to refund 20% of initial ad sales because its ad-based service isn't as popular as expected.

Even speculative hyper-growth blue-chips can only get so cheap as long as their core businesses are intact. So let's take a look at why Tesla is likely a very attractive speculative buy right now. But first, let me show you why even dividend investors should consider buying non-dividend growth stocks like Tesla.

Why Dividend Investors Should Invest In Growth Stocks Too

If you have already retired and expect to die within 10 years, then pure high-yield investing is a perfectly reasonable strategy. Especially right now, in an elevated inflation environment.

Daily Shot

Periods of elevated inflation tend to be when high-yield stocks shine the brightest. How is that possible? Aren't they ""bond alternatives""? Well, actually, no. When inflation and interest rates are high, short-duration assets of all kinds perform best.

Daily Shot

That includes stocks, where the shortest-duration sectors are the ones that generate the most immediate cash flow.

But if your time horizon is 10+ years, including anyone who plans to leave their portfolio to a spouse, children, grandchildren, or charity, then high-yield today isn't the only portfolio goal you should have.

Maximum SAFE LONG-TERM income is what you should be after and that's where a diversified high-yield portfolio that includes hyper-growth stocks like Tesla can work wonders.

The odds are 31 percent -- almost one in three -- that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to age 95. The odds are one in 10 -- 10 percent -- that one member of this couple will live to age 100. But most people aren't financially prepared to live that long or deal with the uncertainty of their actual lifespan."" - CBS News

The Social Security Administration estimates that 10% of retired couples will have one spouse live to 100. So even if you're 65 and retired, a 35-year time horizon is part of any reasonable and prudent retirement plan.

Let me show you how Tesla can potentially turbocharge any high-yield portfolio and help you achieve far more retirement income than high-yield blue-chips alone.

Here is a pure high-yield blue-chip portfolio made up of 50% high-yield exchange-traded funds (""ETFs"") and 50% equally weighted into three of the best high-yield blue-chips on earth.

It yields a very safe almost 5% and offers long-term return potential that's superior to almost any other investing strategy, including the S&P, dividend aristocrats, and even the Nasdaq.

Now consider what happens if we add a modest position in Tesla.

Now we have a 70% high-yield 30% growth portfolio that still yields 3.8% but has 2% faster growth, offering 1% higher long-term returns.

over 30 years, that's potentially 35% higher inflation-adjusted wealth.

But guess what? The extra income this portfolio can generate is a lot more than just an extra 35%.

How many high-yield portfolios do you know of that were able to deliver 19% average rolling annual returns over the last 11 years and kept up with the Nasdaq's 19.7% returns?

But take a look at what happened to the income growth of these two high-yield portfolios.

Portfolio Visualizer Premium

Cumulative Dividend Income Since 2012 Per $1,000 Initial Investment

Metric Pure High-Yield SCHD 70% Yield/30% Growth Total Dividends $807 $789 $853 Total Inflation-Adjusted Dividends $616.03 $602.29 $651.15 Annualized Income Growth Rate 15.3% 15.7% 21.0% Starting Yield 3.3% 3.2% 2.7% Today's Annual Dividend Return On Your Starting Investment (Yield On Cost) 13.7% 13.7% 18.1% 2022 Inflation-Adjusted Annual Dividend Return On Your Starting Investment (Inflation-Adjusted Yield On Cost) 10.5% 10.5% 13.8% Click to enlarge

(Source: Portfolio Visualizer Premium)

16% returns turned into 21% annual income growth, far more than the high-yield portfolios themselves.

The inflation-adjusted yield on cost is now 30% larger. The actual income is slightly larger because it takes around 10 years for superior income growth to kick in.

But most people have 35+ year time horizons.

The 70/30 yield/growth portfolios now going to be minting dividends at a far faster rate. That's because it benefits from triple compounding.

the dividend stocks growth their dividends exponentially

the dividends buy exponentially more shares of dividend stocks

the hyper-growth stocks buy even more high-yield stocks during annual rebalancing.

That big spike in income for the 70/30 yield/growth portfolio in 2020? That was the year Tesla soared 743%. It then soared another 50% in 2021.

That's the Tesla bubble and guess what? Thanks to rebalancing it back to 5% each year, you would have sold Tesla at its outrageous bubble valuations to buy more undervalued high-yield blue-chips.

you were buying safe high-yield with other people's money

over time hyper-growth annual rebalancing will buy far more high-yield stocks than you could ever afford on your own.

High-yield on its own can double compound your income, but if you own growth stocks, you get an entire extra layer of compounding.

Here is the ultimate example of the triple income compounding power of yield + growth, using Altria Group (MO) and Amazon, the best dividend growth stock in history and one of the best growth stocks of all time.

After 10 years, the income was roughly the same. But after 25 years, yield + growth delivered 18.4X more inflation-adjusted income. And take a look at the yield on cost. For every $1 invested in MO and AMZN in 1997, you're now getting $27.35 in inflation-adjusted income per year.

36X more annual income than MO alone.

So now that we can see the logic behind dividend investors owning hyper-growth blue-chips, let's take a look at why Tesla, after its 63% crash, might be a potentially attractive speculative investment.

Why Tesla Is Potentially A Great Long-Term Speculative Hyper-Growth Investment

First, let's start by answering the question all Tesla investors and potential investors are dying to know. Is Tesla's recent issues in China and with rising competition from other automakers hurting its growth prospects?

Daily Shot

After all, Tesla's market share is dropping by around 11% per year.

FactSet Research Terminal

Four months ago, Tesla's median growth consensus was 24.5%, and it's gone up 2% since then.

Growth forecast range: 3.0% to 48.1%.

You might think that Tesla is speculative because of its junk bond credit rating, but that's not the case. S&P upgraded it to BBB stable back in October 2022 because of its strong balance sheet.

Ford's credit rating: BB+ positive (junk bond)

GM credit rating: BBB stable = same as Tesla's.

FactSet Research Terminal

Tesla's debt/EBITDA, or leverage ratio, is 0.15X and is expected to hit 0.1X in 2023. For context, rating agencies consider 2.5X or less leverage safe for automakers.

Today Tesla has $21.5 billion in cash vs. $2.4 billion in debt. And its short-term liquidity is $24 billion. The days of Tesla's very survival requiring selling more stock are over.

FactSet Research Terminal

In fact, by 2027, analysts expect TSLA could have $132 billion in cash on its balance sheet.

However, the future growth outlook is very wide, thus Morningstar's ""very high uncertainty"" business model score and our speculative rating.

FactSet Research Terminal

Tesla's sales continue to be supply constrained, with the company selling all the cars it can build. The days of carbon credits making up most of its profits are long gone, with just $1.6 billion in credits this year, or 2% of sales.

Tesla's sales are expected to grow 30% annually by 2027. In 2022 alone, it's expected to become the 9th largest car maker by revenue and generate 5% of all car maker revenue in the world.

Global Auto Sales 2021

FactoryWarrentyList

In 2023, Tesla is expected to become the 6th largest automaker.

In 2024, the 4th largest.

In 2025, the 3rd largest.

In 2026, it's expected to overtake Toyota (TM) for the #1 spot.

And guess what? Tesla's energy storage business is growing 29% per year, almost as fast as its cars.

Tesla's services revenue of $5.8 billion in 2022 is expected to more than double to $11.4 billion by 2027.

In total, non-car sales (services and energy) make up $10 billion in 2022 sales or 12% of revenue.

By 2025 non-car sales are expected to reach $23.7 billion, more than Subaru's (OTCPK:FUJHF) total sales.

Tesla's non-car sales in 2025 would be the 18th largest automaker.

Tesla's non-automative sales are growing at 33%, the fastest part of the business, and are expected to generate 13% of revenue by 2025.

FactSet Research Terminal

Tesla is expected to sell 1.35 million cars in 2022, 44% more than last year. By 2027, that's expected to grow to 3.3 million cars, a 20% annual growth rate.

by 2027 Tesla is expected to be the 9th largest automaker by vehicles sold, ahead of Renault and behind Ford.

Its average selling price, even with the dominant popularity of the Model 3 and Y, is expected to remain stable at $54,000 per vehicle.

Toyota's average selling price: $25,324 VW (VWAGY, VLKAF, VWAPY,): $33,137 Hyundai: $14,715 GM: $20,178 Stellantis (STLA) (old Chrysler: $28,047).

Thanks to a premium brand that requires virtually no advertising, Tesla's premium price means higher margins even though it's still a young company that hasn't achieved economies of scale.

2021 gross margin: 27.0%

2027 gross margin consensus: 29.9%.

FactSet Research Terminal

Tesla has become a profit-minting machine, with $7.6 billion in net profit in 2021, and that's expected to almost double in 2022.

$1.5 billion of that was carbon credits = 20% of profits

falling to 12% of profits in 2022.

In 2027 Tesla's net income is expected to hit almost $27 billion, with virtually none of that carbon credits.

And where Tesla really shines is free cash flow.

FactSet Research Terminal

Tesla generated $5 billion in free cash flow in 2021 after spending $6.5 billion on growth. Its growth spending is expected to ramp up to $10 billion by 2027.

How does 2027 growth spending compare to its peers?

VW consensus capex: $19.8 billion Toyota's consensus capex: $11.3 billion Stellantis (old Chrysler): $11.2 billion Tesla: $9.9 billion GM: $9.3 billion

And despite aggressive increases in growth spending, Tesla's free cash flow in 2027 is expected to reach $23.6 billion. How does that compare to its biggest peers?

Tesla's free cash flow: $23.6 billion VW: $12.9 billion Stellantis (old Chrysler): $12.3 billion Toyota: $7.7 billion GM: $6.6 billion Ford (F): $3.4 billion

Everyone else is so behind the curve on EVs that they must spend record amounts on developing new EV platforms. That's why Tesla's free cash flow in 2027 is expected to be 2.4X that of Ford and GM combined.

And all this from a new car company that is still improving its production process.

In 2022 Tesla was the 19th most reliable car maker out of 24, according to Consumer Reports.

Yet, despite reliability, that's 44% worse than Toyota's, Tesla's customer satisfaction is impressive.

American Customer Satisfaction Index

80% of Tesla owners are satisfied with their cars, more than Mercedes, BMC, Volvo, Lincoln, and matching Toyota. In fact, just four car brands have higher satisfaction than Tesla, and by just 5% (Lexus).

Imagine what Tesla's customer satisfaction could reach once they improve their reliability. It's very possible that Tesla's customer satisfaction could become the industry standard within five years.

Bottom line: Tesla is a real company with a strong balance sheet that's getting steadily stronger. Its brand is exceptional, and it's one of the fastest-growing car companies on earth for the foreseeable future.

the fastest-growing automaker on earth with an investment-grade credit rating.

Tesla's historical price/sales ratio is around 8.5X outside of bear markets and bubbles.

90% statistical probability TSLA is worth about 8.5X sales.

Wait a second? 8.5X sales for a car maker? Are you high?!

Toyota's Historical Fair Value: 0.7X sales

FAST Graphs, FactSet

Risk Profile: Why Tesla's Not Right For Everyone

There are no risk-free companies, and no company is right for everyone. You have to be comfortable with the fundamental risk profile.

TSLA's Risk Profile Summary

EV adoption risk (mostly tied to the cost of producing the cars)

technology disruption risk (minimal since hydrogen isn't particularly viable)

market share loss risk: uncertainty surrounding potential market share once no longer supply constrained

Key Man Risk: Elon Musk owns 20% of the stock and will own more in 2028 after his options vest

employee retention risk: Musk is an unpopular boss, and it's the tightening job market in 50 years

brand risk: Tesla's margins are almost entirely due to its strong brand

regulatory risk: as seen by the new IRA tax credits, Tesla won't receive

oversees expansion risk: China is Tesla's biggest market, and the government could crack down on foreign EV makers.

How do we quantify, monitor, and track such a complex risk profile? By doing what big institutions do.

There are no sacred cows at iREIT or Dividend Kings. Wherever the fundamentals lead, we always follow. That's the essence of disciplined financial science, the math behind retiring rich and staying rich in retirement.

Bottom Line: Tesla's Crash Has Made It A Bargain Even Dividend Investors Should Consider Buying

Let me be clear: I'm NOT calling the bottom in TSLA (I'm not a market-timer).

Blue-chip quality does NOT mean ""can't fall hard and fast in a bear market.""

Fundamentals are all that determine safety and quality, and my recommendations.

over 30+ years, 97% of stock returns are a function of pure fundamentals, not luck

in the short term; luck is 25X as powerful as fundamentals

in the long term, fundamentals are 33X as powerful as luck.

While I can't predict the market in the short term, here's what I can tell you about TSLA.

one of the fastest-growing companies on earth

26.5% annual long-term total consensus 2X top 2.5X better than the S&P, aristocrats, SCHD, and Nasdaq

56% historically undervalued, a potentially speculative Ultra Value buy

3.8X sales vs 8X to 10X historical

18.3X cash-adjusted earnings = 0.7 PEG = hyper-growth at a wonderful price

615% consensus return potential over the next five years , 39% CAGR, 12X better than the S&P 500

, 4X the risk-adjusted expected returns of the S&P 500 over the next five years

Tesla has revolutionized the automotive sector and built a brand that no other large automaker can match. Does it have risks? Of course, just look at the antics of mad king Musk.

But at a 56% historical discount, Tesla is now a potential speculative table-pounding buy that offers 12X better return potential than the S&P 500 (SP500).

And even if you're a dividend investor, that kind of Buffett-like return potential could turbocharger your long-term income growth and make Tesla a potentially wonderful buy today.

Just remember to size your position appropriately (2.5% or less is our recommendation) within a prudently diversified and risk-managed portfolio.

From everyone at Dividend Kings and iREIT, I want to wish you and yours a safe, healthy, and joyous holiday season:)

Tesla has been cutting jobs after Elon Musk said he had a ""bad feeling"" about the economy.

Workers say they are grateful to have worked for the company despite being let go.

One former senior employee said it had been an honor to work with so many talented people.

Tesla has been cutting workers since CEO Elon Musk declared in June that he wanted to reduce the workforce by 10% but the reaction, in some cases, has been surprising.

Insider has found a number of LinkedIn posts from Tesla employees praising their experience working on Musk's vision of an electric future - despite being laid off.

Monier Ziain, who worked in the autopilot division, said in a post that it was an honor to work with so many talented people. Tesla laid off an estimated 200 workers in the division and closed an entire office in San Mateo, Calif.

She said: ""During the past year and a half, I worked for a company where I genuinely believed in what we were doing. I felt a great sense of pride to work on a project that marks the beginning of future transportation and a full sense of pride in knowing we were the first.""

An engineer in the autopilot division wrote, ""it was the hardest, most time consuming, and most stressful work I've ever done, but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything"", adding that working on the navigation system was one of his greatest achievements.

Some described their time as a journey like no other. Adam Ryding said he joined Tesla in 2016 when it only sold the Model S: ""Some of us (the 10%) might be mad or frustrated, but I'm not. I'm thankful I was part of it, got to learn so many new things and I wish all of my former colleagues the best (no matter what).""

One Tesla data annotation specialist said in a post: ""There is some magic that happens when working hard alongside good people in a tough situation. That magic manifests in various and sometimes unconventional ways. I saw it in our chat channels and shared jokes, trying to make light of difficult and tedious work.""

Story continues

Another former employee said of her colleagues: ""They are artistic, they have sharp eyes, they are emotionally intelligent, and made even the slowest days at work enjoyable because they are good, kind people who look out for each other and know how to keep morale up.""

Aaron Mendoza even said that his layoff ""is just a blessing in disguise"" that will allow him to enter a field more ""suited to my interests and skillset.""

Not all are praising Tesla however. A former XR developer said he believes there were ""a lot of systemic issues at play here.""

Meanwhile, Insider also found a number of recent posts from new Tesla joiners despite Musk asking executives to pause hiring worldwide.

20,"German cybersecurity researcher David Colombo stunned Tesla this week when he discovered a remote control security flaw in a third-party app that can access the EV maker’s electric car software, then promptly hacked 25 Tesla cars in 13 countries.

In what has been described as “the biggest discovery of his young career,” the 19 year-old shared his finding on Twitter, because thankfully he was not a malicious hacker.

Some questioned the motive of the young cybersecurity expert, but Colombo says he only sent commands to cars with owner’s permissions.

I only sent commands to cars where I had the explicit permission of the owner (luckily I was able to figure out a few of them). For all others, the majority, I only validated access (without sending any actual commands to the cars) and then notified the Tesla Security Team. — David Colombo (@david_colombo_) January 20, 2022

In fact, he was very concerned that he was not able to alert the owners that he had hacked their cars. According to him, it was not a Tesla software fault but a flaw introduced by the car owners, themselves.

“This is not a vulnerability in Tesla‘s infrastructure. It‘s the owners’ faults. That’s why I would need to report this to the owners as stated above,” he said.

“Nevertheless I now can remotely run commands on 25+ Tesla‘s in 13 countries without the owners knowledge. Regarding what I‘m able to do with these Tesla’s now, this includes disabling Sentry Mode, opening the doors/windows and even starting Keyless Driving.”

“I could also query the exact location, see if a driver is present and so on. The list is pretty long,” he said.

He also joked that he could “Rick-roll” the Tesla owners (a colloquial term for playing musician Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” randomly to prank people).



Comedian Conan O’Brien also jumped in on the joke, saying on Twitter on Friday (Australia time) that it explained why his car was driving through Bucktail, Nebraska (a non-existent location that, as with Timbuktu, is meant to equate to “the middle of nowhere”.)

A hacker has taken control of 25 Teslas, which explains why right now I’m driving through Bucktail, Nebraska. — Conan O'Brien (@ConanOBrien) January 19, 2022

But on a serious note, Colombo clarified on Twitter that the hack he’d discovered did not allow complete remote control of the Tesla cars, such as steering, acceleration and braking.

However, it could still allow a potential hacker to turn music on and off, or flash the lights constantly, which in themselves could cause accidents if they distracted drivers from safe decision-making.

He said that the Tesla security team contacted him and would be getting back to him.

Last Friday, Colombo said he’d like to see Tesla implement different API scopes, referring to the ability to which an encrypted key allows one program to access another."

If you have an iOS device, there is a setting that lets you automatically back it up to iCloud at predetermined intervals. This is great if you have trouble remembering to do it on your own.

But backing up data to iCloud wasn’t as secure as you’d think. Until now. Read on for details on Apple’s new security setting to protect your data.

Here’s the backstory

Apple recently released an update for iOS devices, bringing the operating system to version 16.2. Pro tip: To improve your iPhone’s battery life, disable these three features now.

The latest iOS version adds a much-needed security tool. Previously, your backups to iCloud weren’t encrypted. If you wanted to encrypt your backups locally, you had to do so through iTunes on your computer.

That has changed with the addition of Advanced Data Protection with iOS 16.2. This means that any iCloud backup benefits from end-to-end encryption.

This is something that many advocacy groups have been fighting for. The Electronic Frontier Foundation asked Apple to add this security feature years ago.

How to enable Apple’s Advanced Data Protection

It is always a good idea to keep your phone updated to the latest version. If you are still on a previous iOS version, here’re how to update your device: go to Settings > General Software Update > Download and Install.

Once you are on iOS 16.2, you can enable the new Advanced Data Protection setting to encrypt iCloud backups. Here’s how:

Open Settings.

22,"Court Gives Its Blessing To FBI’s J6 Geofence Warrant, Denies Motion To Suppress

from the tons-of-data-in-a-pretty-tight-fence dept

Geofence warrants are just part of day-to-day cop business these days. Rather than moving forward with a list of suspects, law enforcement agencies just ask for data on everyone in a certain area at a certain time and move backwards to probable cause to investigate and arrest.

When a bunch of violent jackasses stormed the Capitol in hopes of disrupting a (no longer peaceful) transition of power, they immediately became targets of federal investigators. The Capitol raid gave investigators a haystack of targets, all generating another, larger haystack of location data. The best place to get this data in bulk is from Google, which really enjoys collecting location data.

Shortly after the insurrection attempt, the FBI issued lots of geofence warrants and began working its way back to a (long) list of suspects. How much data the FBI initially obtained wasn’t revealed until a J6 suspect challenged one of the FBI’s geofence warrants in court. It was a lot.

A filing in the case of one of the January 6 suspects, David Rhine, shows that Google initially identified 5,723 devices as being in or near the US Capitol during the riot. Only around 900 people have so far been charged with offenses relating to the siege. […] For the final step, the government sought subscriber information, including phone numbers, Google accounts, and email addresses, for two groups of users. The first was for devices that appeared to have been entirely within the geofence, to about a 70 percent probability. The second was any devices for which the Location History was deleted between January 6 and January 13. From this, in early May 2021, the FBI received identifying details for 1,535 users, as well as detailed maps showing how their phones moved through the Capitol and its grounds.

The suppression motion filed last month has been denied. The ruling [PDF] from the DC District Court does have a few problems with geofence warrants generally, but not this particular one. (h/t Michael Vario)

Drawing from a dearth of precedent (one federal court opinion and six magistrate judge examinations of warrant requests), the DC court moves toward creating some of its own.

First, it says the warrant was not “overbroad,” no matter how much data was sorted through by Google and given to the FBI.

Specifically, Defendant first argues that step one, in which Google provided the Government with an anonymized list of devices falling within the geofence’s geographic and temporal parameters, was overbroad because it required Google to query its entire Sensorvault without probable cause “to search untold millions of unknown accounts in a massive fishing expedition.” But, as the Government points out, the relevant question is not how Google runs searches on its data, but what the warrant authorizes the Government to search and seize. Under Defendant’s theory, no doubt many search warrants and most third-party subpoenas for protected records would be unconstitutionally overbroad because they necessarily would require the third party to search some group of records larger than those specifically requested, whether they reside in a file cabinet or on a server…

The court also says there’s no expectation of privacy in anonymized location data. Referencing the Supreme Court’s Carpenter decision, it says hoovering up massive amounts of data related to hundreds of devices isn’t the same thing as harvesting data targeting a particular device over the space of days or weeks. But even though it comes to this conclusion, it still says geofence warrants have the potential to do damage to Fourth Amendment rights.

Defendant has made no allegation that his or others’ identity was knowable based on the anonymized list produced at step one, and considering the geographic and temporal limitations on the geofence area, it likely would not be possible to deanonymize the list indirectly by cross-referencing more revealing location points—for example, the location where the device spent the night. Accordingly, on the facts of this case, the Court has no basis on which to find that Defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights were implicated at step one. That said, the Court acknowledges that the scope of legally obtainable anonymous data made possible by geofencing technology could present potentially significant risks to privacy, even if those privacy interests cannot be expressed through Defendant’s challenge to step one of this particular warrant, on these particular facts, under current law.

Finally, it says the supposed overbreadth of the warrant was justified by the scope of the (mass) criminal event.

At the outset, because a warrant’s authorization may be “no broader than the probable cause on which it is based,” Hurwitz, 459 F.3d at 473 (citation omitted), it is necessary to define the scope of that probable cause. January 6 was a unique event in a geographically unusual place such that the scope of probable cause was uncommonly large. Because the Capitol building was not open to the public on January 6 due to the counting of the votes of the Electoral College, the fact of having entered the building during the geofence timeframe itself constitutes evidence of a crime… Based on an unusual abundance of surveillance footage, news footage, and photographs and videos taken by the suspects themselves while inside the Capitol building, there is much more than a “fair probability” that the suspects were within the geofence area and were carrying and using smartphones while there, such that their devices’ LH would provide evidence of a crime.

Also, the geofence set up by the FBI was extremely unlikely to cast a dragnet full of innocent bystanders, given the Capitol building’s location.

[A]s relevant to the 37 deleted devices, the area around the Capitol is unusual for its lack of nearby commercial businesses or residences. Indeed, while Defendant does not make any specific allegations about any such nearby buildings, the Court’s best estimate is that the nearest is no less than about a quarter of a mile away, or approximately 400 meters. By Defendant’s own admission, the error radius is not known to exceed 387 meters, Def.’s Mot.Suppress at 8, and the error radius for Defendant’s location points in particular extends only as high as 264 meters… Furthermore, while public streets do appear to be somewhat closer to the geofence area, extensive road closures west of the Capitol, in anticipation of the rally on the ellipse on January 6, including on Pennsylvania Avenue, reduce the likelihood that any stray cars would have been picked up in the geofence error radius…

To its credit, the FBI set up a very tight geofence.

And it could do it in this case because, as the court pointed out, pretty much everyone in the Capitol building that didn’t work there was, at the very least, trespassing on federal property.

And, even if it hadn’t found this particular warrant in this particular case to be constitutional, the court still would have given the government a pass on this one. The good faith exception would apply, especially since the defendant’s particularity arguments seem to focus more on the size Google’s data dump, rather than the warrant approved to obtain the location records from Google.

This denial can be appealed. And maybe it will be. But given the facts of the case here, it seems unlikely the DC Appeals Court will find any reason to overturn the lower court’s ruling. The facts favor the FBI here and the dearth of existing precedent will likely result in future applications of the good faith exception. That doesn’t mean these warrants aren’t worth challenging. It just means this geofence warrant was better crafted than most.

In August, engineer James Damore was fired from Google after writing a viral memo suggesting that women are biologically ill-suited to working in tech. And on Monday, Damore filed a lawsuit against the tech giant, alleging it discriminates against politically conservative white males, BuzzFeed News reports.

Damore was terminated from Google after his ten-page manifesto circulated this summer — in which he argued the gender pay gap in tech was a result of women’s genetic inferiority. Damore subsequently doubled-down on that idea in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, claiming he was fired because his “moral preferences and beliefs” were too out there for the leftist “mob” his bosses catered to. He also later said he believed women should feel “empowered” by his musings.

In his lawsuit, Damore claims Google “singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated” employees who didn’t share the company’s views on diversity. He and a second plaintiff — former Google engineer David Gudeman — are seeking class certification on behalf of conservative Caucasian men. Per BuzzFeed News:

“Google’s management goes to extreme — and illegal — lengths to encourage hiring managers to take protected categories such as race and/or gender into consideration as determinative hiring factors, to the detriment of Caucasian and male employees and potential employees at Google,” the suit reads.

Google had already been served with a different gender-discrimination suit earlier this month; a group of women alleged in a revised lawsuit that the company asked for their salary histories and paid them less than their male counterparts. BuzzFeed News notes that Damore’s suit had been expected after he publicly hired attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon — the Republican National Committee’s Committeewoman for California — back in August."
25,"Google to Roll Out Gambling Apps on Google Play India

Posted on: September 9, 2022, 08:33h.

Last updated on: September 9, 2022, 12:03h.

India may still be trying to determine what constitutes gambling, but Google hopes to create the definition. It’s starting a pilot program this month that will allow certain gambling apps on Google Play in the country.

A consumer holds a Google Play gift card. The Android games and app platform will pilot limited gambling apps in India. (Image: Getty Images)

Google is opening its online app store to local developers who create daily fantasy sports (DFS) and rummy apps, the Alphabet-owned company, said Thursday. This is a massive switch from the platform’s mostly anti-gambling stance, although real-money gambling remains a sensitive topic.

Developers can now submit their requests to participate in the pilot program, which could start on Sept. 28. It will run for a year, after which, if authorities in India don’t intervene, it could become a permanent addition to Google Play.

Google has long held a policy prohibiting real-money gambling apps in Google Play. But the pilot program seems to indicate a change. However, developers who participate in the program will not be able to use Google’s own billing system. Instead, they will need to find third-party solutions.

In addition, they will have to make sure their apps conform to local regulations. For example, they cannot violate local state laws, must have proper licenses, and must ensure no one under 18 can access the apps.

Responding to Demand

The initiative, according to Google, is in response to requests from users for the inclusion of DFS and rummy. It could also be because of the potential money the company could make as it changes its policies.

Three Indian companies, Dream11, Mobile Premier League, and Games 24×7, offer Android DFS, each worth more than $1 billion. Users have to side-load the apps but might soon find them in Google Play if accepted to the program.

The Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS) indicates that the country’s fantasy sports market was worth $4.35 billion last year. By 2025, it predicts it will be worth over $20 billion.

Indian’s Hazy Gambling Laws

In India, The Gambling Act bans chance or luck-based games but does not ban skill-based games. But the country has had difficulty coming up with a consensus on this definition.

The legalization of poker still has difficulty finding support. The same holds true for legal Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS). Rummy, however, is readily embraced everywhere and remains extremely popular across the country, with over 76% of the population playing the game, according to some estimates.

DFS proponents in Karnataka won a victory in overturning a ban in February. However, Assam, Telangana, and other regions still have bans.

Divisive Decision

Although welcomed by some, not everyone is happy with Google’s decision. Accusations of Google’s “discrimination” and “abuse of position” are starting to emerge.

The CEO of the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF), Roland Landers, said the move is a step in the right direction but doesn’t go far enough. He asserts that there are plenty of other games that Google should include. Landers added that the move will force smaller companies out of the business since they won’t be able to compete with deep-pocketed organizations.

There needs to be a rethink on this decision failing, with which Google may invite litigation. This certainly creates an unnecessary distinction between the different kinds of games offered under the [real-money games] category in the fast-emerging gaming industry,” said attorney Abhishek Malhotra.

FIFS welcomes the move, as does PayTM First Games. Several Indian states banned PayTM last year, so the decision is a small vindication for the company."
26,"Universities ostensibly employ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) staff to create more tolerant and welcoming environments for students from all backgrounds. A previous Heritage Backgrounder documented that the number of people devoted to DEI efforts has grown to about 45 people at the average university.REF This Backgrounder examines whether these large DEI staff are, in fact, creating a tolerant and welcoming environment on college campuses. In particular, this Backgrounder examines the extent to which DEI staff at universities express anti-Israel attitudes that are so out of proportion and imbalanced as to constitute antisemitism.

To measure antisemitism among university DEI staff, we searched the Twitter feeds of 741 DEI personnel at 65 universities to find their public communications regarding Israel and, for comparison purposes, China. Those DEI staff tweeted, retweeted, or liked almost three times as many tweets about Israel as tweets about China. Of the tweets about Israel, 96 percent were critical of the Jewish state, while 62 percent of the tweets about China were favorable. There were more tweets narrowly referencing “apartheid” in Israel than tweets indicating anything favorable about Israel whatsoever. The overwhelming pattern is that DEI staff at universities pay a disproportionately high amount of attention to Israel and nearly always attack Israel.

While criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitic, the inordinate amount of attention given to Israel and the excessive criticism directed at that one country is evidence of a double-standard with respect to the Jewish state, which is a central feature of a widely accepted definition of antisemitism.REF Frequently accusing Israel of engaging in genocide, apartheid, settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and other extreme crimes while rarely leveling similar criticisms toward China indicates an irrational hatred that is particularly directed toward Jews and not merely a concern for human rights.

The evidence presented in this Backgrounder demonstrates that university DEI staff are better understood as political activists with a narrow and often radical political agenda rather than promoters of welcoming and inclusive environments. Many DEI staff are particularly unwelcoming toward Jewish students who, like the vast majority of Jews worldwide, feel a strong connection to the state of Israel. The political activism of DEI staff may help explain the rising frequency of antisemitic incidents on college campusesREF as well as the association between college and graduate education and higher levels of antisemitic attitudes.REF Rather than promoting diversity and inclusion, universities may be contributing to an increase in anti-Jewish hatred by expanding DEI staff and power.

The Context

There has been a sharp increase recently in antisemitic incidents worldwide,REF in the United States,REF and particularly on college campuses.REF According to Hillel International, the main university organization for Jewish students, there were 244 antisemitic incidents reported during the mostly virtual 2020–2021 school year compared to 181 during the prior year when everyone was on campus for in-person instruction.REF

DEI staff are supposed to be working to prevent such incidents rather than foment them. According to the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education Standards of Professional Practice, “Chief diversity officers work with senior administrators and campus professionals to develop, facilitate, respond to, and assess campus protocols that address hatebias incidents, including efforts related to prevention, education, and intervention.”REF DEI staff are supposed to prevent hate/bias incidents directed at any student group: “Chief diversity officers have ethical, legal, and practical obligations to frame their work from comprehensive definitions of equity, diversity, and inclusion—definitions that are inclusive with respect to a wide range of identities.”REF

But the activities of many DEI staff lend credence to the title of David Baddiel’s recent book that “Jews don’t count.”REF Not only do DEI staff fail to attend to Jewish concerns, including scheduling events on Jewish holidays, but there have been reports of diversity officials expressing antisemitic attitudes. The most prominent example of this from the corporate world was when Kamau Bobb, the head of diversity at Google, wrote that Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war” and an “insensitivity to the suffering [of] others.”REF Amazingly, Bobb was only reassigned to work on STEM education efforts for Google.REF Bobb let the mask slip by accusing “Jews” of these crimes rather than simply saying “Israelis” or “Zionists.” If DEI staff maintain that cover, they might be able to get away with expressing virulent antisemitic statements without even being reassigned to new positions. This Backgrounder examines empirically how common these kinds of antisemitic statements are from university DEI staff.

The Method

The previous Backgrounder, “Diversity University,” identified 2,933 DEI staff at 65 “Power Five” universities. Primarily using Google searches, we found 797 Twitter accounts linked to these DEI staff. Of those 797 accounts, 56 were “protected” so that tweets could not be viewed. That left 741 accounts that could be searched for antisemitic content.

Almost all of these were personal accounts, not operated by the universities themselves. Thus, they provide a window into what these DEI staff believe and how those beliefs may shape their university work.

The publicly available Twitter feeds of these DEI staff were searched for comments related to Israel and, for comparison purposes, China. The specific search terms to find comments related to Israel were Israel, Palestine, Palestinian, and Gaza. The search terms for China were China and Chinese. The searches found all mentions of these terms in the tweets, retweets, and “likes” of tweets associated with these accounts. Researchers coded whether each tweet indicated a positive or negative view toward Israel and China, respectively.

Of course, this approach does not find all public communications from DEI staff regarding Israel and China. Not all DEI staff have accounts on Twitter. Some accounts may not have been found by Google searches involving their name and institution, especially if individuals avoid mentioning their real name and employer on social media. Some people automatically delete their tweets, retweets, and likes periodically, making it impossible to find earlier communications. People may describe Israel or China using words other than those that were used as search terms. Moreover, the application used to facilitate searching truncates some tweets and places a cap on how many tweets can be searched per user. For all of these reasons, the results presented in this Backgrounder are a conservative undercount of public communications. Nonetheless, the patterns that this imperfect method yield are likely an accurate presentation of the broader picture of DEI staff sentiment toward Israel and China.

The Results

DEI staff have a disproportionate interest in Israel relative to China and are far more likely to be critical of Israel than they are of China. In total, there were 633 tweets regarding Israel compared to 216 regarding China—three times as many—despite the fact that China is 155 times as populous as Israel and has 467 times the land mass. China has also had many reasons to be in the news recently, including being the origin of the pandemic, conducting a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, mass imprisonment and mistreatment of China’s Muslim Uyghur population, increasing confrontation with Taiwan and other countries in the Pacific Rim, and severe internal repression of political dissent and private corporations. One who is genuinely interested in human rights around the world had many more reasons to be paying attention to China than to Israel.

Of the 633 tweets regarding Israel, 605 (96 percent) were critical of the Jewish state. Of the 216 tweets regarding China, 133 (62 percent) expressed favorable sentiment.

Examples of Tweets About Israel

The severe tone and extreme content of the tweets, retweets, and likes critical of Israel are even more illuminating. There is no reason to identify individual DEI staff, but quoting from their tweets and counting the use of hyperbolic rhetoric is important.

For example, the word apartheid appears 43 times in DEI staff public communications about Israel. One retweet by a Multicultural Student Affairs staff person asserted that “the State of Israel is guilty of the human rights crimes of apartheid and persecution. Settler colonialism is fundamentally violent. And it begets violence.” Another remark retweeted by someone in an Office of Inclusion and Diversity stated that “one cannot teach radical geog/critical urban theory without a curriculum on this settler colonialism & apartheid.” A tweet by a Multicultural Student Center staff person declared, “Condemn the Apartheid State of Israel for their Human Rights Violations against the Palestinian.” An assistant director of an Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity lamented, “no apology for a pro apartheid Zionist organization holding a reception? I guess there’s no justice for Queer Palestinians here.”

Some variant of the word colonial appears 39 times in tweets, retweets, or likes by DEI staff. A person working for Graduate School Diversity Programs liked the message, “Y’all love to add the word liberal in front of the most evil things and it’s unhingedddd. Wtf is a liberal Zionist? What’s next? Liberal Nazi? Liberal colonizer? Liberal murderer? Liberal imperialist? Liberal fascist?” One staffer at a Multicultural Student Involvement and Community Advocacy Center endorsed the following: “You cannot disentangle the colonization experienced by indigenous ppl from the racism experienced by black ppl from the xenophobia experienced by latinx ppl from the imperialism experienced by palestinians. They’re all different extensions of the same oppressive project.” A person in an LGBTQ Equity Center retweeted, “Re Palestine, you gotta understand: there’s no ‘controversy.’ Most people around the world know that Israel brutally colonizes the Palestinians. The issue is only ‘controversial’ because Zionists pitch a fit whenever anybody speaks this truth.”

The word genocide appears nine times, the term ethnic cleansing appears seven times, and the accusation that children are specifically targeted appears 27 times. The assistant director of an Asian Pacific student center tweeted, “#Gaza is under attack. This is genocide. #FreeGaza.” One DEI staffer retweeted, “what you need to understand is that these are entire BLOODLINES being wiped out. generations upon generations completely GONE. their indigenous history with them.” A staffer in a Center for Educational Outreach retweeted, “israel has a particular loathing for children. they target them with violence specifically and intentionally every single day.”

The public communications of DEI staff embrace the genocidal phrase from the river to the seaREF five times. One message declares that “‘from the river to the sea’ means that we will decolonize every block and every grain of sand in palestine. go ahead and fuel people to make us look like we’re bloodthirsty for the death of jews when you’ve just killed 42 family members in one airstrike.” Another states, “Every Israeli bomb and bullet used against Palestinians and paid for by USA dollars has been consummated by the blood and soil of American Indians. From the river to the sea and from sea to shining sea, we shall be free.”

Angela Davis,REF the former vice presidential candidate for the Communist Party who was accused of supplying the guns that resulted in the killing of a judge, features prominently in DEI staff tweets. So does former CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill, who was fired by the network for his antisemitic statements.REF One LGBTQ center staff person who is also an instructor tweeted, “I ordered ‘Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique’ which I think I’m going to pair with Angela Davis’ ‘Freedom is a Constant Struggle’ in my LGBTQ activism class in the spring!” The director of an African American Cultural Center posted a photo with the following description and quotation from Davis: “The Black Panther Party & a Palestinian delegation at the first Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers, 1969. ‘The Black radical tradition is related not simply to Black people but to all who are struggling for freedom … our histories never unfold in isolation.’—Angela Davis.”

While American Jewry is rarely mentioned specifically in these public communications from DEI staff, their alleged role in facilitating Israeli crimes is often in the subtext. An Outreach and Engagement librarian retweeted, “Tell U.S. Jewish leaders: Stop defending #Gaza assault.” One multicultural consultant liked the message, “Jewish people are not responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, but we are responsible for calling out violence and human rights abuses when we see them, especially when the people committing the violence claim to be doing so in our name.” A DEI staffer at a Big Ten school was clearly describing the supposedly insidious influence of American Jews when he liked this message: “There’s a vast philanthropic-lobbying complex in the US that works tirelessly to present Israelis as benevolent, peace-loving, and fundamentally reasonable victims of Palestinian aggression, and meanwhile in actual Israel no one bothers with the pretense.”

The relatively small number of tweets, retweets, or likes by DEI staff favorable toward Israel—28 in total—are tepid compared to the fire-breathing tone of those that are critical. Sometimes the praise is mixed with criticism of Israel. For example, a leader of an Office of Diversity and Inclusion liked this mixture of praise and criticism: “Dear Israel, you have a story to tell that is important and often glorious. But you don’t tell your story by keeping people out. You tell it by opening your arms, sharing the complexity and challenges and inviting exchange and ideas.” An associate dean for diversity and inclusion praised Israel’s democracy while denouncing its leader: “The beauty of a democracy is the right of people to elect the wrong person. Jerusalem, Israel.”

Other positive comments lamented insufficient attention to Israeli and Jewish contribution to progressive causes: “why no coverage in the media?: Thousands of Jewish protesters join 500,000-strong Women’s March… via @timesofisrael.” But most of the favorable tweets were about trips to Israel, Israeli scientific innovations, or expressions of support for memorials. The closest thing to a full-throated defense of Israel can be found in this tweet liked by an associate at a Multicultural Engagement Center: “The Jewish people are indigenous to Israel, the birthplace of our identity and unique culture, and have maintained a documented presence for over 3,000 years.” But this tweet is the only one like it among the more than 600 tweets, retweets, and likes found in DEI staff Twitter feeds.

Examples of Tweets About China

The favorable tweets about China also tended to be more tepid than those that were critical, but they were far more common. For example, some positive tweets focused on partnerships between the DEI staff person’s U.S. university and government or educational institutions in China. One Big Ten DEI official stated, “A real pleasure to meet China’s Vice Minister of Ag and Rural Affairs Han Jun in Beijing last night to discuss Ag and food innovation…. Wonderful conversation with great plans for the future.” An assistant provost at another university praised the success of her institution’s president at establishing partnerships with Chinese universities: “President Stresses Internationalization Opportunities on Trip to China. [University president] signed five cooperative agreements with Chinese universities and was a featured speaker at an event for globalization in academia.”

Another common type of tweet favorable to China was to extoll China for its efforts to combat COVID-19. An associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion endorsed this message: “Chinese medics have just arrived in London to help us fight Covid-19. The media won’t tell you for some reason.” A multicultural consultant at another university affirmed, “Thank you to psychologists from Wuhan, China for helping @APA to learn from their experiences of #COVID and improve our ability to care for the #mentalhealth & needs in the #USA.”

Other DEI staff expressed favorable sentiment toward China to counteract what they perceived to be anti-Chinese bias. A staff person at a Center for Multicultural Affairs expressed concern: “when are people going to realize that anti china propoganda [sic] directly correlates with a rise in hate crimes against Asians.”

A few people offered strongly worded praise of China. An LGBTQ staff person seemed to think that it would be better to be a trans person in China: “i wonder a lot if it would feel easier to come out to my parents if i was a ~binary trans woman~ or what the f*** ever b/c they at least have a frame of reference for trans women celebrities in China.” Another DEI staff person endorsed this tweet from the People’s Daily newspaper in China touting how China had improved the lives of people in Tibet: “China’s Tibet Autonomous Region had lifted 530,000 people out of poverty during the five years to 2017, reducing poverty rate to 12.4% from 32.3% at the end of 2012, the regional poverty relief office said Friday.”

The smaller number of tweets regarding China that expressed criticism tended to focus on human rights issues. An associate dean for diversity and inclusion retweeted, “Human rights experts estimate that 1.5 million Uighur Muslims and members of other ethnic minority groups, including Chinese-born Kazakhs, have been detained in Xinjiang since 2016.” The assistant director of campus inclusion and community responded to a Bloomberg news headline that said, “China looks at cutting inequality in order to boost the economy” by asking, “Good for China. But also are they still doing that Muslim genocide? Why we ain’t also talking about that?”

A number of negative tweets about China addressed the treatment of African residents in China. An associate provost for inclusive excellence retweeted, “In China, African residents are alleging anti-black racism resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.” Others expressed concern about Chinese efforts to use technology for surveillance. An assistant dean for equity and inclusion endorsed these concerns: “Google built prototype of a censored search engine for China that links users’ searches to their personal phone numbers, thus making it easier for the Chinese government to monitor people’s queries.”

The extreme language used in tweets regarding Israel almost never appeared in tweets regarding China. There are no occurrences of the words apartheid and ethnic cleaning, nor is China ever accused of targeting children in these tweets, retweets, and likes. The term colonial does appear twice, but it is used favorably toward China. For example, one tweet asserted that people “talk about China like a British colonial officer from 1850.” The term genocide does appear four times in tweets about China, but that is less than half as common as the term was used with respect to Israel.

The overall picture, however, is that DEI staff were less likely to offer criticisms of China than of Israel, and those criticisms tended to be less strongly worded. It would be impossible to review the inordinate attention that DEI staff pay to Israel relative to China, the nearly universal attacks on Israel versus general praise of China, and the dramatically different tone used in discussing Israel and China without concluding that DEI staff have an obsessive and irrational animus toward the Jewish state.

The Definition of Antisemitism

Some people might object that just because DEI staff express criticism of Israel frequently and forcefully does not necessarily mean that they are antisemitic. According to a widely accepted definition of antisemitism, however, criticism of Israel constitutes antisemitism when it exhibits certain characteristics. This definition was formulated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)REF and has been endorsed by governmental bodies around the world, including the European Parliament, the U.S. State Department,REF and the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights,REF which oversees the activities of DEI staff at universities.

The IHRA definition suggests the following as examples of antisemitism:

“Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor”;

“Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”;

“Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”; and

“Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.”

The tweets, retweets, and likes of DEI staff documented here provide instances of all of these antisemitic qualities. The frequent use of terms such as apartheid and colonialism are meant to portray Israel as a racist endeavor and deny its right to exist as the homeland of the Jewish people. The forceful denunciation of Israeli responses to rocket and terrorist attacks prominently feature a double standard, as only the Jewish state is expected not to defend its citizens in a way that all other countries would. The sparsity of criticism of China relative to Israel is also strong evidence of a double standard. Accusing Israel of genocide or ethnic cleansing is clearly meant to equate Israeli policy with that of the Nazis. And demanding that U.S. Jewish leaders denounce Israeli actions or accusing them of hypocrisy for failing to do so are clear examples of holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel’s behavior.

Conclusion

According to Gallup data, 95 percent of American Jews support Israel.REF While that figure is lower among younger Jews, a large majority of Jews at American universities feel connected to the state of Israel as part of their Jewish identity. Even if the hyperbolic and obsessive criticism of Israel expressed by university DEI staff did not meet the definition of antisemitism (which it clearly does), attacking a central feature of Jewish students’ identity would be entirely contrary to the stated purpose of having DEI staff: to welcome students from all backgrounds, make them feel included, and prevent or address incidents of hate and bias. But it is clear that DEI staff at universities actually function as political activists, articulating and enforcing a narrow and radical ideological agenda.

Truly achieving diversity, especially ideological diversity, and helping all students feel included requires a dramatic change in how universities approach DEI. Existing staff need to be dramatically reduced, and the remaining DEI infrastructure needs to be reoriented toward serving the true purposes of diversity and inclusion.

I HAD the fruit tasting of a lifetime here last month. It went on for 12 hours over two days. By the end I had sampled several hundred different kinds of apples, some like no apple I’d ever tasted before.

At least eight varieties tasted hauntingly of roses. Several surprised me with the distinct taste of anise or fennel. There were aromas of all kinds. Flowers and spices and nuts, including coconut. Lots of other fruits: orange peel and lemon, strawberry, pineapple, green banana. Rhubarb. Occasionally, popcorn, and potatoes. Some apples seemed to suffer from confused genus identity and tasted like pears.

It was exhilarating to experience such different flavors in apples brought here from all over the world. It was also frustrating, because I might not ever be able to experience them again. The United States was once home to more than 10,000 named apple varieties, but nowadays it’s hard to find more than a handful, even at farmers’ markets.

The best place to get an idea of the apple’s diversity is here in the Finger Lakes region, an hour northwest of Ithaca, at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Plant Genetic Resources Unit, home to the world’s most extensive collection of apple varieties and relatives."

“Jewglers” is one of many employee groups at Google, where there are also “Gayglers” (for LGBTQ+ employees), “Greyglers” (for older ones) and “Vetnet” (for veterans). The Jewglers’ 2,800 Jewish members mostly use its listserv to seek travel advice, share recipes and plan the company Hanukkah party.

But a progressive contingent cleaved off the group last summer after the Jewglers protested a company donation to the Movement for Black Lives. Now, a pair of letters from the breakaway group protesting Google’s business dealings with Israel has pitted the two Jewish bodies against each other in a fight for influence at the company.

The second letter, published anonymously this month in The Guardian, called on Google and Amazon to withdraw from Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud-computing services contract with Israel, saying it would “make the systematic discrimination and displacement carried out by the Israeli military and government even crueler and deadlier for Palestinians.” The same letter, signed by hundreds of employees from both companies, was sent directly to the companies’ executives.

Organized under the group name Jewish Diaspora Solidarity, the anti-Zionist breakaway group is trying to challenge the prevailing pro-Israel Jewish voice at Google. Those employees first took their concerns public in May, with an open letter demanding Google support its Palestinian employees and cut ties with the Israeli Defense Forces. That letter, published during the 11-day war between Israel and Islamic militants in the Gaza Strip this spring, was followed by similar statements from employees at Amazon and Apple.

Pro-Israel Jewish employees had already been raising questions about how Google addressed antisemitism, and the company’s nonresponse to the May letter further infuriated them. They had also complained of bullying after an employee posted anti-Zionist reading material on internal message boards.

During the racial-justice protests that followed the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, Google’s donation to the Movement for Black Lives, which had been harshly critical of Israel’s policies toward Palestinians, angered some Jewglers members. Four of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from their employer, described a debate over Israel and antisemitism that has roiled the Jewish community at the company ever since.

Google has addressed neither the letters nor employee complaints about them, and instructed employees to not talk to the press. Several employees reached for this story declined to comment even anonymously. One likened Google’s surveillance of its 140,000 employees to Communist Russia.

A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

A million-dollar dispute

Though the Jewglers group forbids political discussion, it does serve a diplomatic purpose within the company, representing the Jewish voice both to other workers and to company management. The group successfully lobbied for kosher food in the cafeteria, for example, and when Google scheduled a company-wide meeting on a Jewish holiday, unsuccessfully sought a reschedule. More recently, the administrators of the group sent a message expressing Jewglers’ solidarity to the Muslim employee group, “[email protected],” regarding China’s persecution of Uighur Muslims.

But when Google announced a $1 million donation to the Movement for Black Lives — part of a $175 million commitment to Black causes following Floyd’s murder — Jewglers protested. The Movement for Black Lives’ 2016 charter had called the United States “complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people,” and referred to the security barrier separating Israel from the West Bank as a “U.S.-backed apartheid wall.”

The Jewglers said this violated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which the group had officially adopted. At least one member called the genocide claim a “modern-day blood libel.” Others noted that while antisemitic violence was rising in the United States and around the world, Google had never made a company-wide statement supporting Jewish staff, let alone a large financial investment in groups fighting antisemitism. The group asked that Google replace the Movement for Black Lives with another racial equity nonprofit.

Google went through with the donation as planned. Months later, it agreed to donate $100,000 to each of four nonprofits fighting antisemitism selected by Jewglers — on the condition that the donations would not be publicized. One Jewgler characterized this as “throwing us a bone.”

Jews against Jewglers

But a small contingent of anti-Zionist Jewglers opposed the donations, which went to the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, an Israeli nonprofit called Fighting Online Antisemitism and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

They noted that the co-founder and CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is Rabbi Marvin Hier, who supported former President Donald Trump’s controversial relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. And like the Wiesenthal Center, the ADL has been accused by progressive groups of weaponizing antisemitism to defend Israeli policy. The contingent formed an unofficial breakaway employee group, Jewish Diaspora Solidarity, which Ariel Koren, one of the group’s founders, said now has more than 400 members.

Koren said that while Jewglers administrators enforced a ban on political speech when it came to criticizing Israel, pro-Israel messaging on the listserv was routinely tolerated. Still, she said, no one was looking to form an alternative to Jewglers until it seemed necessary.

“If it was really just about dialogue or conversation, I don’t think we would have written the letter or formed the group,” said Koren, a product marketing manager, who said she also supported the Movement for Black Lives donation. But employee groups “also create a sort of moral authority in terms of speaking for an entire community,” she said, “so if you’re an executive, you’ll turn to the pulse of that community when you’re making decisions.” That’s why, she added, “we needed the alternate space that represents young Jewish Americans in a more accurate way.” (Koren later clarified that the group also has older and international members.)

The May violence that engulfed Israel and Gaza was, in many ways, the real breakpoint between the two groups of Jewish Google employees.

The war, and the attendant rise in antisemitic attacks on Jews in the United States, prompted the Jewglers to ask the company’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team for a solidarity statement similar to one Google had issued months earlier amid a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans. Group members pointed out that Google had an office in Tel Aviv, where workers were ducking into bomb shelters several times a day as sirens warned of rockets incoming from Gaza, and that American Jews had been attacked while eating in restaurants and walking to synagogue.

Meanwhile, the breakaway group was imploring Google to respond to the suffering on both sides of the conflict.

“We as Jews do not endorse the views of those who have written to you seeking to garner support for exclusively pro-Israel and pro-Zionist actions,” read a letter titled “Jewish Diaspora in Tech,” which the tech publication The Verge made public

“I’m not particularly proud to work at Google over the past week and a half,” one Jewglers member said in an interview this summer. “Antisemitism is not a political issue. It’s a Jewish issue.”

on May 18. It identified the approximately 600 signers as “a coalition of diverse Jewish and allied Googlers concerned about the internal dialogue” around the crisis, and called on workers at other tech companies to add their names.

The letter listed five demands: center Palestinian voices at Google; fund Palestinian and Israeli relief equally; issue a companywide statement recognizing the conflict that includes “direct recognition of the harm done to Palestinians by Israeli military and gang violence;” and protect anti-Zionist speech at Google. The letter also called on Google to terminate contracts with institutions “that support Israeli violations of Palestinian rights, such as the Israeli Defense Forces.”

Some Jewglers recoiled, calling the letter antisemitic and demanding a company investigation of the people who released it to the public.

An escalating conflict

Two days after the Jewish Diaspora letter went public, The Verge reported that members of the Apple Muslim Association had collected 1,000 signatures on a letter asking the company for a statement acknowledging the suffering of Palestinians; the next week, hundreds of workers at Amazon, Google’s partner on the cloud-computing contract, signed a letter echoing some of the demands of the Jewish Diaspora letter.

Neither Amazon nor Apple responded publicly to its employees’ open letter.

In a statement to the Forward, an Amazon spokesperson said, Amazon Web Services “is focused on making the benefits of our world-leading cloud technology available to all our customers, wherever they are located.”

Apple declined to comment.

Back at Google, internal message boards were aflame. One employee said a colleague posted the writings of Norman Finkelstein, a prominent critic of Israel, and that the diversity team ordered that stopped.

Some Jewglers were bitter that, given their group’s statement supporting the Uighurs, the Muslim employee group had not said anything about the rising antisemitism in the U.S. They also said that simple suggestions they made to management about condemning antisemitism were ignored, including a refusal to share a link to a public Anti-Defamation League event.

“I’m not particularly proud to work at Google over the past week and a half,” one member of Jewglers said in an interview at the time. “Antisemitism is not a political issue. It’s a Jewish issue.”

Then, in June, the conservative Washington Free Beacon surfaced a 2007 blog in which Kamau Bobb, who had since become Google’s head of diversity strategy, had said that Jews have “an insatiable appetite for war.” Google removed Bobb from his role but did not fire him from the company.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which had been one of Google’s four antisemitism grantees the summer before, launched an ad campaign condemning Bobb’s continued employment as a “clear message that Google embraces a double standard in which antisemitism is less offensive and less worthy of opprobrium than other forms of hate.”

Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Wiesenthal Center said the organization was grateful for Google’s donation but was concerned about the company’s policies.

“If you’re a firefighter, and you get two magnificent firetrucks, and one of those little planes that drop stuff, that’s a wonderful donation,” he said by way of analogy. “But if the same source is helping to start fires all over, do you say is that enough? Hell no, that’s not enough.”

A dark cloud over Israel?

The letter the Jewish Diaspora group released earlier this month was more pointed than its predecessor; this time, Google employees were specifically protesting their company’s involvement in a business deal with Israel, known as Project Nimbus.

The project provides cloud services — file storage on the internet, rather than in on-site servers — to host and deliver information for government ministries and other public entities. As co-winners of the contract, Amazon is building three data centers in the country and Google is building one reported to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

But Koren, the Diaspora group member, said that because the contract did not give Google control over which Israeli agency uses the product or for what purpose, it would likely be used by the military and other departments, including the Israel Land Authority, in ways the group found problematic. The technology “allows for further surveillance of and unlawful data collection on Palestinians,” the letter said, “and facilitates expansion of Israel’s illegal settlements on Palestinian land.”

“Imagine being a Palestinian worker at this company,” Koren said in an interview, “being told that you can’t know what’s going into this contract, and knowing that the product is going to be used against your family.”

The day after the letter was released, Google.org — the company’s charitable arm — announced a €5 million (about $5.8 million) commitment to combat online antisemitism through monetary grants and in-kind ad donations on YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the conglomerate that holds Google.

Koren said that more than 600 Google workers had signed the letter as of Oct. 22, and that the Jewish Diaspora group, which is open to all, was growing. Its FAQ originally defined the group as “anti-nationalist, anti-colonialist, anti-Zionist Jews and allies.” But Gabriel Schubiner, a Google software engineer who co-wrote an OpEd for NBC News protesting Project Nimbus, said not everyone in the Diaspora employees group shares all those values. The FAQ introduction was later changed to “We are Jews and allies who honor our Jewish anti-colonialist traditions.”

Both he and Koren demurred when asked for the group’s position on a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“We’re a group of employees — we’re not trying to solve the conflict,” Schubiner said. “We’re trying to understand the relationship between technology and the conflict, and trying to mitigate the impact on human rights and human suffering that increased technology could bring.”"

30,"Advisers have been receiving an increasing number of clients asking about ESG investments but the lack of standards around disclosure is creating obstacles for advisers.

Several institutions – including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board – are, however, working to form these standards.

Speaking at the Professional Planner Researcher Forum, Zenith Investment Partners head of responsible investment and sustainability Dugald Higgins said Australia remains quite limited with how it approaches fund transparency and holding data.

“If you’re an ethically-driven investor and you can’t see a fund holdings data you’re effectively blind dating because you don’t know what’s in that portfolio,” Higgins said.

Despite this, he said funds are passing the age of rhetoric and into accountability.

“A big part of where we’re at now with looking at funds and how the industry presents itself,” Higgins said. “The big difference we have right now is move from ‘tell us what you’re doing’ to ‘show us what you’ve done’.”

Higgins added a big part of how this new age will work is transparency.

“Transparency is key – transparency in the process, transparency in the holdings, transparency in stewardships, in actions, in outcomes, transparency in metrics like carbon.”

ESG v sustainable v responsible investing

Higgins said the industry often conflates ESG and sustainability, clarifying that ESG is looking at external factors that can impact a company’s value while everything a company does that impacts the world is sustainability.

“If you’re confusing ESG and just an investment process inside a portfolio that’s only designed to look at risks and opportunities and then mixing that up with a company that’s trying to be sustainable… they’re not necessarily the same thing,” Higgins said.

Ethinvest general manager Fiona Thomas said there are many ways to keep track of what is occurring within the ESG investing space.

“For an investment to be classified as an impact investment for us [Ethinvest], there needs to be a precise measurement process in place.”

Thomas believes people do not understand the difference between ESG factors, responsible investing, and sustainable investing.

“The other things they don’t do is google ESG advice or ESG investing, that’s not how people view the world so they will say ethical investing or responsible investing. There are terms other than ESG that are far more understood by the general public.

Thomas said Ethinvest does in-house research to take the complexity out of the range of terms and products for clients.

“[Reviewing the] strategy, the intention, breaking down the holding of the funds and then we give them a rating,” Thomas said.

“We try to simplify what is a very complex decision. We do the research for our clients; we don’t expect them to understand the difference.”

The greenwash

Since ESG investing came into existence, greenwashing has become an issue but this year the regulator has begun a crackdown on misleading marketing practices in responsible investing, with Vanguard being the latest culprit.

ASIC defines greenwashing for investors as “the practice of misrepresenting the extent to which a financial product or investment strategy is environmentally friendly, sustainable or ethical”. This definition has caused several funds to scramble through their marketing material and revise it.

Thomas said she was pleased by ASIC’s initiative and the acknowledgement of greenwashing as problem.

“Because we’ve been operating in this space and with clients that care about this for so long, we were pleased to see there would be penalties for companies that make false claims,” Thomas said.

“It makes it easier for good fund managers that are doing the right thing to not be mixed up in the swill of everybody launching a product because there is so much coming to market.”

CFS head of investment sales George Walker said with ESG becoming mainstream and reaching the mass affluent it was natural that greenwashing would happen.

“You want to make sure you’re standing behind what you do and you’re authentic,” Walker said.

“We’re really big on reporting – making sure we can come back and prove you said what you’re going to do is happening.”

Zenith was acquired by European-based analytics research house FE fundinfo in late 2021, which Higgins said has given his research firm greater perspective across how ESG regulations work in different markets.

He added he saw the industry in Australia going down either a prescriptive or principals-based path for ESG regulation.

“Prescriptive guidelines, which they have in Europe, they’re good as guiderails but products are so nuanced it ends up being a poor fit,” Higgins said.

“Principles-based guidelines, which is essentially what ASIC has done, gives you a great deal of flexibility and the ability to future proof against the inevitable shifts in the landscape. The problem is you’re subject to interpretation.”"
31,"Shareholders launch campaign to tie Elon Musk’s salary to Tesla’s ESG

Shareholders have launched a campaign to tie Elon Musk’s salary to Tesla’s ESG performance.

Shareholders, spearheaded by activist investor Tulipshare, have launched a campaign to tie Elon Musk’s salary to Tesla’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.

The announcement comes months after the electric vehicle (EV) powerhouse was booted from S&P’s ESG index.

According to Tulipshare, tying the chief executive’s salary to ESG would ensure the company improves its sustainability while delivering a stronger performance to investors.

Currently, Musk’s pay is tied to Tesla’s performance and that has led to an increase in investors’ returns.

“Facing multiple lawsuits because of its lack of ESG focus, it is time that investors – including retail investors – hold Tesla’s CEO accountable,” said Antoine Argouges, chief executive of London-based Tulipshare.

“This will not only deliver better profits in the long-term but will ensure the company can deliver on its mission to accelerate the world to a more sustainable world.”

Over the last few months, Tesla has been at the centre of several lawsuits.

Former staff members sued the EV maker in June over “mass layoffs” while a month later fifteen former and current employees alleged they had been subjected to racial abuse and harassment at Tesla’s factories.

The announcement comes as Tesla’s revenue and gross margins for the quarter were below analysts’ forecasts.

Revenue was a record $21.45bn (£19bn) but still down on analysts’ estimates of $21.96bn while gross margins slumped to 27.9 per cent.

The car maker is also expected to miss delivery targets, as it told analysts on Wednesday night that year deliveries would grow less than the expected 50 per cent on 2021 levels.

City A.M. has approached Tesla for comment."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the fundamental good the electric car maker does will be measured in the acceleration of the world to sustainable energy. Tesla's role in the auto industry's move to electrification is undeniable. Many major automakers are now investing billions in EV and battery manufacturing, and consumer interest in EVs continues to grow. While a Pew Research Center survey this summer found only 7% of U.S. adults currently had an electric or hybrid vehicle, 39% said they were considering an electric vehicle to be the next car they bought. ""One of the many things he did is he pushed the industry toward taking EV seriously,"" former Ford CEO Mark Fields said of Musk. Tesla didn't surpass 1% share of new car sales until 2018, but during the first half of 2021, Tesla's share of the all-electric segment of the auto market stood at about two-thirds. ""Profitability as a pure EV maker is an accomplishment in and of itself,"" said Driss Lembachar, manager of transportation and infrastructure research at Morningstar's Sustainalytics. Tesla 's stock price, now near-$900, and its rise to a near-$1 trillion company, shows that investors have been rewarded for sticking with a company that five years ago traded under $50 amid constant reporting on financial struggles. But for ESG analysts including Lembachar, ""There is some room for improvement.""

Beyond Tesla earnings and sales

As Tesla reported record profits and sales in its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday and demand for its EVs show continued growth, its balance sheet becomes less volatile, and it ramps up manufacturing around the globe — including operations in Europe and China — its success is also an indication that Tesla has passed beyond its roots as a California start-up (where it is no longer even based). It's becoming a more mature automaker. That is one reason ESG experts are watching closely to see how Musk's company evolves in relation to investor concerns about environmental, social and governance issues. Yana Kakar, global managing partner emeritus at Dalberg, said when the ESG debate is boiled down to a choice between whether the product a company produces is good, such as a Tesla EV, or the way it produces the product is good, that is a mistake. ""That's a false dichotomy,"" she said. ""There is no necessary tradeoff. It is not a zero-sum game."" How a company produces its products can be a reflection of the same values in the products it creates, and ""that is entirely achievable,"" Kakar said. This debate over Tesla has a parallel to the rise of Silicon Valley companies that are ""revolutionizing"" industries and, as a result, have to keep their focus on that primary goal and not ESG. ""That attitude has been particularly prevalent in Silicon Valley,"" said Jaakko Kooroshy, head of sustainable investment research at FTSE Russell. ""But investors have come around to the view that a company can continue 'saving the world' and also have decent sustainability disclosures, and those disclosures do matter in the context of the company trying to save the world."" He added, ""The line from Tesla for a very long time was 'we are busy here saving the world so who cares about our emissions disclosures and corporate governance mechanisms.""

Tesla shareholders are pressing company on ESG

The recent Tesla annual shareholder meeting showed how investor pressure is being applied to the company, with a measure for diversity, equity and inclusion reporting approved by shareholders over management objections. The vote came shortly after a legal case in which a former Tesla contract worker sued over a hostile work environment and was awarded $137 million. ESG experts say it is a sign that Tesla shareholders are making their voices heard, but it will be another year before ESG experts and shareholders can assess any changes made by Tesla in response to the shareholder measure. Shareholder measures are non-binding, and though corporate management often enacts changes in response to shareholder wins, it is not always with the scope or comprehensiveness that shareholders expected.

watch now

To date, in spite of all of the ""good"" the company is doing related to climate change, Tesla has not had the best ESG track record. JUST Capital, an ESG research nonprofit founded by Paul Tudor Jones, ranks Tesla among the bottom 10% of all companies on ESG — its ESG methodology is weighted more heavily to broad social issues than climate specifically. FTSE Russell has Tesla ranked last among carmakers globally on ESG issues. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its ESG philosophy.

Environment and climate

ESG rating agencies, in the early days of the industry, don't yet agree on how to assess Tesla even on the ""E"" of environment with which it is synonymous. Lembachar said on the environmental pillar in ESG, ""They are one of the best ... it goes without saying they produce only cars without emissions, and they have been credited for that."" But in 2018, FTSE Russell gave Tesla a ""zero"" on environment because even though its revenue sources are green and its cars are non-emitting, the company didn't disclose its own operational emissions. Historically, Tesla did not provide transparency in terms of reporting its Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions, water use, or waste management. But Tesla has improved as investors pressed for more information and it has started publishing more corporate disclosures in recent years, said Kooroshy, which has led to an improvement in Tesla's environmental ranking in the FTSE Russell ESG analysis.

watch now

How Tesla deals with the waste it generates and its water usage, particularly as it is starting to scale around the world and provide millions of vehicles, does matter, he said. There are many ways to produce EVs, some cleaner and some more problematic, and supply chains and sourcing of raw materials such as cobalt, which goes into batteries, and human rights and labor issues in regions where minerals are sourced, need to be considered by investors as risk factors. ""What is clear is that Tesla has made some improvements, but compared to many of its peers in the auto industry, its environmental reporting is still fairly rudimentary,"" Kooroshy said. ""They are conscious of, and made commitments to disclose more data points in future, and as they do, when they do, we will see it reflected in those ratings.""

Labor

On balance, social and governance issues remain the major hurdles for Tesla. MCSI places Tesla above average in its rankings, but not as an ESG leader. ""If you look at labor management or product safety quality, we see some issues there,"" said Arne Klug, vice president of ESG research at MSCI. ""We couldn't say that the company's programs, in terms of labor management, or product safety, quality, are really aligned with its growth strategy based on our assessment."" In March, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Tesla violated federal labor laws while United Auto Workers and other unions tried to organize at its original plant in Fremont, California. The NLRB also found Tesla guilty of ""coercively interrogating"" three employees over unionizing activities, illegally firing another and disciplining another. For JUST Capital, worker issues are one of the primary reasons Tesla gets ""tripped"" up in its rankings, said Martin Whittaker, CEO. How a company supports local communities, what is it doing on diversity, and what it is doing on fair pay and worker issues, are all issues that JUST weighs more heavily than climate alone in its overall ESG rankings because Whittaker said, ""the public weighs them highly."" The labor issues will pose a material risk to Tesla as it expands around the world, Lembachar said, as they do for any company with global operations where a confrontation with a labor force at one site can increase the risk of more general strikes. ""Workforce issues can have more of an effect now that the company is getting out of this start-up stage and expanding around the world and in Europe, where there is a really strong union tradition,"" he said. ""The company must be prepared for labor-related risks and, according to us, must have stronger labor-related programs prepared to tackle issues related to the expansion of its workforce engine around the world.""

Autopilot as an ESG issue

Tesla is facing investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding Autopilot, the automated driving technology currently in Tesla's Models 3, S, X and Y in 2021. While it may at first not seem obvious how self-driving is an ESG issue, it in fact falls within traditional categories that date all the way back to the days of Ralph Nader and ""unsafe at any speed"": product safety and passenger safety. Lembachar said Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) is something his firm receives a lot of questions about as an ESG scoring metric, but he says it is simple: ""Anything related to passenger safety is product governance and falls under the 'Social' pillar. Everything related to recalls, accidents, defects, responsibility of company is product governance."" He was quick to point out that if self-driving works it may ultimately cut down on accidents by as much as 90%, and Tesla is potentially far ahead of competitors with the technology. But in a period of time when it is being scrutinized as the cause of accidents and fatalities, self-driving remains a product governance negative, and that metric has a heavy weighting for the auto industry. That hits other companies, too, such as GM after its recent recall on electric cars due to battery fire risk. And Lembacher said these issues have a material cost: for GM, more than $1 billion in the case of the recalls. ""That is a very material issue,"" he said.

Corporate governance and Tesla' ESG future

Even though tweets may seem ephemeral, Musk's confrontation with the Securities and Exchange Commission over controversial tweets can negatively impact the company's corporate governance score. ""In terms of corporate governance, we see the confrontation between Musk and the SEC as problematic,"" Lembacher said. ""Tweets are problematic when they change the share price and that can be harmful for shareholders ... and that's why the SEC has been flagging it. There is a risk that the regulator at some point will sanction the company and since we are running a risk rating product, we have to flag this issue."" Questions also remain about the company's acquisition of SolarCity, which was controlled by Musk's cousins (a legal case is ongoing brought by shareholders). The corporate governance issues raise a bigger question about Musk's impact on ESG ratings. ""It is not enough to say the company is being run by a 'genius' and as a result, 'please don't ask us too many questions,"" Kooroshy said. ""There is no doubt about the achievements of this company, particularly about accelerating the transition to sustainable energy. This is stuff for the history books, but at the end of the day, for investors trying to understand how much of a portfolio to invest in this company ... not enough, he said. ""It's still not a free pass. ... Making these disclosures doesn't stop them from innovating."" Kakar said Tesla's mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, and its focus on that as an argument in its defense, is implicitly a relative statement comparing itself to other automakers, and that is where the false tradeoff comes in. ""It is terrific they are making EVs ... but relative to the next guy is not the important point, and doesn't obfuscate responsibility."" Many ESG investors and ESG investment products today accentuate the ""E"" and climate specifically. ""That's where the action is at and investors have seen it as a good story, and if you think about environmental performance and climate as the big opportunities, you see Tesla as a big solution and will be attracted to it,"" Whittaker said. But as any company grows in scope and scale, the range of issues they have to contend with changes and investors will ask more about the ""how"" behind the growing business. And ESG experts stress that any rating they provide isn't a buy or sell rating on a company, but a risk rating to be factored into an investor's broader analysis. ""That's what is going to happen with Tesla as people become more aware of the social risk of how it operates,"" Whittaker said. ""It is bound to become more of an issue for investors and more of an operational risk for the company if it doesn't perform well ... more prominent in the overall calculus of company competitiveness and success."" ""That is not to say it won't do well,"" he added. ""Musk is an incredible entrepreneur and business leader and I am sure if it becomes an issue he thinks will affect the value of the company or brand, he will respond accordingly. I expect it will become more of an issue for the management team to have to deal with."""
33,"The next ‘dot com’ crash? Blockchain ETFs enter bubble territory

Blockchain equities have exploded in recent months, driven by the bitcoin rally which has seen many companies post three-figure returns since the start of 2021.

One product capturing much of this upside has been Europe’s only ETF offering direct exposure to blockchain, the $1.1bn Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain UCITS ETF (BCHN), which has increased in size by more than 35% year-to-date, courtesy of $382.7m inflows, according to data from ETFLogic.

BCHN’s popularity was most pronounced in the week to 19 February, in which the ETF saw inflows of $163.1m, pushing its AUM up by almost 15%.

Demand for the product has also been reflected in its performance with returns of 49.6% year-to-date, adding to the 95% rise in 2020.

Europe vs US: Time of the bitcoin ETP has come

Underlining this was the performance of the ETF's top holdings - Canaan, Silvergate Capital, and MicroStrategy - which, at their respective peaks in February, were worth around five times what they were just three months earlier.

Analysts highlighted the main cause of this bullishness as being the feverish surge in crypto valuations, with bitcoin jumping from $9,688 to $54,123 during the twelve months to 22 February. Likewise, the currency has surged 85.1% during the year-to-date.

The latest bitcoin resurgence was fuelled by reports that institutional investors had begun buying into the currency, with initial excitement compounded by the likes of PwC which pointed to professional buying as the driving force behind crypto hitting “record levels”.

As this excitement began to wear off, Tesla revived the bitcoin buzz by declaring that it had invested $1.5bn in the alternative currency – which in turn gave its rally enough steam to add an additional $20,000 to its valuation since the start of February.

Tesla, ESG and bitcoin: An unholy trinity

With investors of all levels of sophistication pouring in to chase an opportunity seemingly too good to miss, blockchains – in their capacity as the digital ledger for crypto mining and transactions – have been operating across more than 12,000 nodes to facilitate the safe and traceable trading of bitcoin on a global scale.

However, despite a number of positive developments in recent months, there is a growing feeling among analysts that the higher bitcoin climbs, the more it will take for the hype train to keep rolling.

And, should new, sensational headlines fail to materialise to sustain cryptos’ currently inflated valuations, one gets the sense that the ominous dot com bubble comparisons become increasingly apt.

As Barnaby Barker, investment analyst at SCM Direct, said: “Blockchain technology is undeniably a useful form of encryption, however the recent valuation of both blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies appears to have been driven by speculative excess rather than fundamentals, with FOMO appearing to be a core driving factor.

“History may not repeat itself but it has a rhythm, and there are many similarities between the current blockchain/crypto boom and the tech boom of the early 2000s.

“The latest “Fad” ETFs appear to rely on greater fool theory, whereby they can only be justified on the basis that an even greater fool will come along to pay an even higher price.”

Aside from its high valuation and illiquidity, investors should also be worried about bitcoin’s historical volatility, with the asset having dropped from $18,640 to $6,332 in less than two months between 2017 and 2018.

Commenting on the crypto’s recent surge, Ben Seager-Scott, head of multi-asset funds at Tilney, said: “The result has been a very volatile ride, and there are vanishingly few assets I know of that have rocketed without a fundamental investment case (including valuation considerations) and have stayed at such elevated levels.”

With alternative currency trading at unprecedented volumes and crypto ETPs making their debut in North America, investors should also be wary that such activity will attract the gaze of regulators. Should this lead to further, new restrictions – following the FCA’s ban of crypto ETNs being sold to retail investors – this would incur downside risk to the current valuations of crypto assets.

Industry bemoans FCA’s decision to ban crypto ETN sales to retail consumers

Even avoiding a repeat of the events of 2017, bitcoin’s current price is hard to justify. It would not be unreasonable to predict a correction, and this, in turn, would see blockchain equities reverse a good portion of their recent gains.

It is certainly true that blockchain has applications outside of cryptocurrency and will likely claim an increasing share of financial services’ back-office functions in coming years, as highlighted by Chris Mellor, head of EMEA ETF equity and commodity product management at Invesco.

“BCHN invests in a wide range of stocks exposed to different forms of blockchain technology, from token investment and cryptocurrency mining plays at one end of the spectrum through to enterprise blockchain in financial services and technology at the other,” Mellor added.

One challenge for BCHN, as highlighted by Laurent Kssis, managing director of 21Shares, is the majority of pure-play blockchain companies are yet to publicly list so are not available to be included in the basket.

“Instead, most companies with the potential to generate earnings from blockchain have well-established businesses in other areas, and blockchain merely presents an additional source of revenue,” Kssis said.

BCHN’s top five holdings have all more than doubled in the year-to-date illustrating just how directly the performance of blockchain equities are dictated by the crypto market.

Likewise, with bitcoin falling 5.4% on 22 February, BCHN’s three largest holdings fell by 15.9%, 5%, and 9.1% apiece during the same day.

Unfortunately, this means that for now, we should view the short-term prospects of blockchain the same way we look at assets like bitcoin. While the technology could well have a meaningful role within mainstream finance in the years ahead, its close correlation with crypto currently makes it a speculative investment – and one that is due a decline.

Offering some hope, Barker concluded: “I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a major correction, but feel that once we do, there will still be underlying demand for these companies (strongest will survive) until the next encryption technology arrives.”"
34,"“I agree we need to have a team that understands the product needs of more than just the young male user, but we just can’t find them,” said Ankur Jain at the first board meeting of his startup Humin in May 2013. This is the same explanation that all Silicon Valley companies — both large and small — provide, to justify their dearth of women technologists.

I advised the Humin team to network with women’s groups and look harder. And that is what it did. By broadening their search process, they found a depth and breadth of female talent, especially among developers whose original background was in engineering fields beyond computer science. Today, six members — one-third — of Humin’s engineering team of 18 are women. Two of the women have a Ph.D.

This is why I look at Google’s gender data with disappointment and don’t buy its excuses.

Google’s gender-diversity should be better than Humin’s, not just 17 percent. Consider that women comprised 37 percent of the computer science class of 1987. Because of the unfair hurdles they face, women are getting discouraged from studying computer science, and the percentage had fallen to 18 percent by 2012. But about a quarter of today’s pool of highly experienced software developers is female, and a company such as Google — which has its pick of the crop of new graduates as well as experienced engineers — should have far greater diversity.

I will give Google credit, though, for having the courage to release the diversity data and acknowledge a problem. Other Silicon Valley companies have refused to do that, likely because they have a lot more to be embarrassed about than Google does. Data collected on Github revealed that the percentage of women engineers at other tech companies is commonly in the low teens or lower. It was reported to be 5.54 percent at Qualcomm’s development center in Austin; 6.3 percent at Dropbox; 8.25 percent at Yelp; 13.16 percent at Airbnb; and 14.39 percent at Pinterest.

I also give Google credit for working to fix the gender imbalance and to the Google for Entrepreneurs group for being supportive of projects that help women — including a crowd-created book that I am finalizing about women in innovation.

A common problem in Silicon Valley is that the interviewers for technology jobs are usually young men, and that the job specifications are geared towards finding young nerds. The hiring process is like recruitment into a fraternity. Until Dropbox recently made wholesale changes to its hiring practices, the conference rooms where interviews were held were named “The Break-up Room” and “Bromance Chamber,” and applicants were sometimes asked what they would do in the event of a “zombie apocalypse” or what they were “geeky about.” Needless to say, it is such antics that turn women developers away and serve to discourage girls from studying computer science.

Fixing the gender gap isn’t that hard, as the Humin team learned. Here are some things that Google and other companies can do.

Look at how jobs are defined. Jobs are often written to solicit responses from males, with long lists of required skills — which are often superfluous. Women tend to pass up opportunities for which they don’t have the exact skills, whereas men will often apply if they have a subset, explains Lucy Sanders, CEO of The National Center for Women & Information Technology. She says that companies also tend to hire women into lower-status technical roles.

Broaden the talent pool by looking beyond the usual recruitment grounds. Companies need to build ties to universities where there are high proportions of women and minorities, and to recruit at conferences that women engineers attend, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and Women 2.0.

Interview at least one woman and one member of a minority for every open position. Freada Kapor Klein, founder of the Level Playing Field Institute, says companies should implement a rule such as the Rooney Rule for National Football League teams. This requires all teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operation jobs. The key is to make sure that every hiring pool is diverse with respect to gender and race.

Have at least one woman on the hiring team. Telle Whitney, CEO of the Anita Borg Institute, cites academic research that shows that people tend to hire those who are similar to them. She says that the demographics of the hiring team greatly influence the outcome of hiring. They also affect offer acceptance. A female candidate will recognize that the business values diversity if the interviewers are men and women, and she is more likely to join the company if offered a job, Whitney says.

In hiring decisions, the focus should always be on competencies rather than on credentials. Klein says that degrees from a prestigious school usually weigh heavily over the ability to write code or solve problems. Candidate-screening criteria such as unpaid internships, summer international experiences and gap years also create an unfair advantage because these are signs of a wealthy background and not of achievements. She says that companies should focus on “distance traveled” — such as the demonstrated ability of people who grew up in modest circumstances to overcome adversity, or to be the first in their families to go to college.

Jain says that the women Humin hired brought many new insights. These led to the addition of many new features and a better product design. Humin now has a product that is likely to appeal to women and minorities as well as to men, greatly increasing the chances of market success when it is launched later this year.

The technology industry, too, could be increasing its market success — if it fixed its diversity problems."
35,"What’s the news: Compensate kin of delivery workers who died on duty, demanded gig workers unions in a letter to food delivery apps Zomato and Swiggy on August 1. The Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers (IFAT) and the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) reached out to the companies following the death of two delivery executives in Indore, Madhya Pradesh and Gachibowli in Hyderabad, Telangana respectively.

Why it matters: Gig workers’ safety and security is an issue recognised at the Parliamentary-level. In July, Swiggy workers launched an indefinite strike to protest low wages, reduced incentives and safety concerns. The strike was later temporarily halted. The news of these deaths highlights the dangers faced by these workers who are not defined under any existing central labour laws. Difficulty in availing compensation is one such issue cited by an IFAT official.

IFAT demands justice for workers: As per the letter, the IFAT demanded that the companies compensate 22-year-old Zomato worker Sunil Kumar’s family with ₹50 lakhs (approximately $63000 based on the current exchange rate) aside from the compensation due to the delivery person under the Workmen Compensation Act.

Further, the IFAT also demanded that Zomato officials in Indore pursue the matter with local police and other authorities “to bring the culprits to book.” Kumar was brutally assaulted and murdered on July 28 while delivering an order at around 10:30 pm in Karol Bagh, under Banganga police station. According to union members who brought the incident to light, Kumar was allegedly waylaid, robbed of money and stabbed by three men. Surviving the ordeal, Kumar rode his motorcycle to the Maharaj Yashwantrao hospital but later succumbed to his injuries. He is survived by his parents and wife.

On top of failing to meet the deceased’s family, IFAT said Zomato failed to coordinate with the police for addressing the issue.

“We demand that Zomato takes urgent remedial steps to ensure the safety of its delivery personnel and covers them with insurance and social security benefits so that these lowly paid personnel are ensured of decent work conditions,” said Shaik Salauddin, IFAT General Secretary in the letter. IFAT said that it will pursue the matter until Zomato takes the required corrective measures to ensure that incidents of assault and death of delivery personnel do not happen anymore, adding that it is willing to collaborate with Zomato to discuss and ensure implementation of safe and decent work conditions for delivery riders.

Zomato’s response: However, a Zomato spokesperson in conversation with MediaNama dismissed these allegations stating that local officials have been in constant touch with the family since the day of the murder. When asked whether the company is in touch with the police, the spokesperson said, “In these situations it is important to cooperate with the police since it is difficult for the family to cater to police requirements.” Stating that Zomato helped the police and the family with the investigation and Kumar’s funeral respectively, she said the insurance due to the family is “already in process.”

Zomato did not comment about the demand for additional compensation of ₹ 50 lakh.

Swiggy worker’s kin pending compensation? A day after Kumar’s death, another Swiggy delivery person died in a road accident while on-duty in Gachibowli, Hyderabad. Ahmed is survived by his wife and his two-month-old child.

According to Salauddin, who is also the Founder and State President of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union, 24-year-old Swiggy worker Adil Ahmed was delivering an order when a tractor hit him from the back. Following the incident, TGPWU tweeted about the death.

At the time, Swiggy had responded to the tweet on the social media platform via a link stating “We [Swiggy officials] are processing an insurance grant of 10 lakhs and have covered the medical expenses.”

24-yr old Adil Ahmed, a Swiggy Delivery worker, lost his life today while delivering an order near Gachibowli . He is survived by his wife & 2-month-old child. @TGPWU demands rightful and swift compensation by @Swiggy according to the Workmen Compensation Act. See below 👇 1/2 pic.twitter.com/ZdAEXqHDyv — Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (@TGPWU) July 29, 2022

We are deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident and have been in touch with the family of our delivery executive Adil ever since the incident. While nothing can make up for this loss, we are committed to supporting them in all ways (cont) https://t.co/ZPr65BeLDb — Swiggy Cares (@SwiggyCares) July 29, 2022

Despite the virtual response, the family is yet to hear from the company, said the union. MediaNama reached out to the delivery company, which said it has been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and processed his hospital charges. With regards to compensation, Swiggy said provides all delivery partners with accident insurance “with no opt-in required.”

Longstanding demand for security: As per union leaders, demand for social security has been a longstanding demand of workers. Even in the case of assaults, delivery persons in other cities have also suffered such attacks by customers. Metropolitan cities like Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru have reported multiple incidents of attack on gig workers, said Salauddin.

In May, an Ola-cab driver Muhammad Ali was murdered in Thane, Maharashtra, reported Sabrang India. Diva police arrested four adults and a minor boy for robbing the driver of his mobile phone and money and leaving his partly-naked body near a gutter bridge on May 29. At the time, IFAT’s Maharashtra unit had urged the government to consider the need for a social security code for gig workers.

As such, the IFAT decried the Zomato company for failing to acknowledge the issue and take corrective measures to ensure the safety of its personnel or ensure provisions of insurance and other social security benefits.

Workers organise to assert demands: Earlier in July, Swiggy delivery workers had launched a protest to demanded better wages and safety and security provisions. They paused their strike in Bengaluru when the company agreed to consider workers’ grievances. The company asked for a week’s time that concluded on July 30. At the time, about 3,000 workers protested in Bengaluru out of ITAF’s national strength of nearly 50,000 app-based drivers and food delivery riders in India. Sources said that workers are planning the next plan of action as the deadline asked by the company comes to an end.

A group of French environmental activists are sueing Apple for indulging in planned obsolescence and various other wasteful practices. France becomes the latest country after Brazil to call out Apple’s marketing and sales tactics that they are trying to greenwash.

Greenwashing, in its most basic form, is when a company tries to virtue signal about the environment and appear that they care about the environment and are taking active steps to battle various environmental issues. In reality though, they may not be doing much at all.

What makes Apple worse when it comes to greenwashing, is the fact that it goes out of its way to make devices obsolete and sometimes downright unusable, just a few years after introducing them.

Apple is also one of the most vocal opponents of the Right To Repair movement.

Apple, in all its wisdom and glory decided that it would be a great idea to take the charger out of the retail box of the iPhone, and sell it separately. Apple would explain that the reason they were doing so was to help save the environment as people don’t usually need to upgrade their chargers that often. Apple has also introduced a monitor with an attached power cord, that cannot be removed by users, or by regular repair services, but only by authorised service centres.

The motion has been filed by Halt Obsolescence Org, advocacy group that fights for the right to repair and for the tech industry to shy away from planned obsolescence strategies.

“In many of the cases documented in the complaint, malfunctions are found in cases where the device is repaired with a part, even an identical and original part, not authorised by Apple’s software,” the HOP association said in a statement.

This would compromise the possibility to repair or refurbish some products, including iPhone smartphones, the group said.

In a similar case brought before the French consumer watchdog by the group in 2020, Apple agreed to pay 25 million euros ($26.32 million) for failing to inform iPhone users that updates of the operating system could slow down the functioning of the device. However, back then, the charges were mainly for consumer protection. This time around, Apple is also charged for damaging the environment with its practices."
37,"The National Center for Public Policy Research has doubled down on its criticism of Apple's sustainability programs. In a blog post, NCPPR CEO Amy Ridenour suggested that Apple is ""greenwashing"" itself, or faking its commitment to sustainability, and she suggested that Apple CEO Tim Cook may have even faked his outrage and anger during Apple's annual shareholder report last Friday.

Is Apple Greenwashing? Please...

Let me say right up front that Ms. Ridenour is wrong about Mr. Cook's reaction. As the guy who started the worldwide attention on Mr. Cook's angry response, I am supremely confident in my read on Mr. Cook and positive that for the first—and probably last—time, we saw an angry Tim Cook in semi-public.

Ms. Ridenour didn't offer any evidence that Mr. Cook was faking the whole thing, saying simple, ""We wonder if Mr. Cook's outrage was feigned."" Again, it wasn't, but she did offer a reason why he might have done so, saying:

Tim Cook didn't get paid some $40 million in 2013 because he's an environmentalist, but he is more valuable to Apple when he plays one on TV. As such, Tim Cook's statement may simply have been public relations. He looked nice and green, standing there, indignant that someone might think one of the world's most successful companies should focus on... business success.

So...Apple CEO Tim Cook, head of the world's most profitable technology company, is worth more to Apple when he's pretending to be an environmentalist. Ms. Ridenour doesn't explain how exactly this works, but she did trot out a series of straw men and false equivalencies that might make anyone who didn't actually consider her words believe that Apple is just faking the whole ""green"" thing.

For instance:

What constitutes a ""green"" company is subjective, but it is hard to imagine that Apple qualifies. Minimalist packaging is a big priority within the sustainability movement. Apple's packaging is beautiful, but not minimalist.

This one is kind of weird, because Apple revolutionized PC packaging. Remember how PCs, or even an Apple Mac before Steve Jobs came back to Apple, were packaged. Multiple boxes within a large box, and sometimes, even two large boxes. Apple's packaging is the definition of minimalist in the world of technology.

In its environmental footprint, Apple even makes the financial case for reducing packaging, as summarized in this image:

This is part of what Tim Cook meant when he said that sustainability is good for the bottom line, and it's likely part of why Apple has received praise from the hard-to-please Greenpeace.

The article continues with the NCPPR questioning Apple's environmental bona fides.

Questioning Apple's Environmental Bona Fides

The NCPPR blog post also accuses Apple of being green only when and where it's convenient. For instance:

And then there's cap-and-trade. Apple was all for reducing U.S. carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade law. But Apple does a very substantial amount of its manufacturing in China, which would not have been subject to the law. Would the same be true for all current and future Apple competitors?

This is a straw man argument, at best. Apple manufacturing most of its stuff in China doesn't nullify its position on cap and trade in the U.S. The company has substantial operations in the U.S., including growing manufacturing capabilities and existing component manufacturing.

The NCPPR is trying to suggest that Apple is advocating for cap and trade only where it won't pay a price for any rising costs that may arrive as a result, but all of Apple's U.S. operations will be effected for good or for ill by cap and trade.

I should also add that Apple has growing sustainability programs in place in China and Taiwan that exceed any local regulations, including programs to improve water recycling and waste disposal. These efforts run directly contrary to the idea that Apple is only green where it's convenient, and these efforts stand alone amongst Apple's competition.

More:

Apple is extremely good at looking green. This is what the famous environmental groups call ""greenwashing."" Why is Al Gore on its board? Because of his technology and innovation expertise or because he helps make Apple look green? Why did Apple hire the Obama Administration's scandal-plagued Environmental Protection Agency chief? Was it because executives who circumvent transparency laws are highly prized, or because hiring her helped make Apple look green?

The NCPPR presents its argument with two negatives presented as an either/or, a logical fallacy known as a false dilemma. This is the equivalent to me asking an Android user, ""Did you buy an Android device because you hate quality or you were concerned that Google didn't have enough access to your personal data?""

Obviously there are additional possibilities. In the case of Apple, it's possible that Al Gore was added to Apple's board because he is an expert in environmental law, environmental technology, and environmental policy. All of those things have clearly been helpful to Apple in the last few years.

He was also added to Apple's board under the late Steve Jobs, a man not known for adding window dressing to anything for any reason. The right's vendetta against Mr. Gore is...weird, and this includes the NCPPR's long-running campaign against the former vice president as an Apple shareholder.

Continued with NCPPR criticisms about the lifespan of Apple devices.

The Lifespan of Apple Devices - Do You Really Want to Go There?

Apple's Mac computers and iOS devices have lifespans that far exceed the broader PC world, let alone the Android world in mobile devices. Despite this, the NCPPR attempts to paint Apple as a company that grinds out disposable devices, and that this is more evidence that Apple doesn't care about the environment.

From the NCPPR:

Observers should remind themselves that Apple manufactures devices that use a lot of energy and Apple works hard to assure that customers will want to replace them every few years, if not sooner. Apple's business plan includes making its products disposable. Is this a sustainability strategy, or a return-on-investment strategy?

The above is one interpretation of reality, but here's another. Apple has worked harder than every other tech company on the planet to make its devices use less energy. Its mobile devices, for instance, have smaller batteries or get longer life from the same size battery than the generation before.

Perhaps the NCPPR doesn't understand how hard that is, and how it's made possible by Apple's control over its hardware and software, and in its extensive involvement in working with its supply chain to develop best-in-class components.

Apple's devices are also used far, far longer than anything made by its competitors. One of many reasons for that is Apple's support for legacy hardware with each new release of OS X and iOS. The NCPPR's statement suggests that Apple has callously exploited planned obsolescence to make older devices useless, but the exact opposite is true.

Apple also has an extensive recycling program in place that makes it easy to recycle those ""disposable"" devices. From the company's dedicated Apple Recycling Program page (it's the first Google search result for ""apple recycling program"" - who knew?):

Send us your old iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC for reuse or recycling. If it has monetary value, we’ll apply that toward an Apple Gift Card. If not, we can recycle it responsibly for you.

My snide side wants to say that's yet another example of Apple faking it. As more fakery, Apple will let you mail in your device—including third party mobile devices—or take it into one of the company's hundreds of Apple Store locations.

The article continues with my conclusions.

The NCPPR Bleeds Six Color - For Real

The NCPPR has been an all-Apple shop since 1985, with no interruption. That's seriously cool, and in my book, that history means they can lay legitimate claim to being fans of Apple and its products. Ms. Ridenour does just that repeatedly in Wednesday's blog post, and she uses that banner to say that the NCPPR will remain activist investors in $AAPL. From the post:

Neither the National Center for Public Policy Research nor its top executives have any plans to sell our shares in Apple. We've been an Apple-only office since 1985 and do not intend to abandon the company in any respect despite CEO Tim Cook's invitation to do so. Cook does not have the authority to determine who is allowed to be a shareholder.

Of course, Mr. Cook wasn't claiming or trying to assert such authority. The implied, but not directly stated, claim that he did is just another use of rhetorical shenanigans to misrepresent reality. Mr. Cook instead said that if the group wanted him to make decisions based solely on ROI, they ""should get out of the stock.""

To me, it's a shame that the NCPPR falls back on such sloppy arguments. At the root of this entire tempest in a tea cup was their stated original goal of getting Apple to be more transparent about its membership in ""certain"" trade groups promoting green agendas.

That goal—transparency—is laudable. More corporate transparency about almost everything would be good for consumers, society as a whole, and ultimately corporations, too. The problem is that the NCPPR isn't really interested in corporate transparency.

What drives them is promoting their radical view of denying climate change and the idea that mankind could be responsible for climate change, and the equally radical view that publicly-owned businesses should pursue profits at the expense of...everything else.

Fortunately, Apple is a company that thinks differently about such things. Apple has shown that doing so, that working to leave the places it does business better than when they got there, can be fabulously profitable, and that appears to drive Ms. Ridenour and the other people at the NCPPR nuts."
38,"I f you own an iPhone and use Spotify, you may have a useful new feature to look forward to when exercising this year. It’s claimed that the music streaming app will sync with the health data on your iPhone to generate personalised music playlists for workouts.

Here’s what you need to know about the rumoured new feature, including how it could impact your music recommendations and privacy.

Is Spotify integrating Apple Health data?

Developer Chris Messina, who keeps an eye on Spotify code to watch out for incoming features, has identified code that shows HealthKit integration is being developed.

However, the feature isn’t yet available, and neither Spotify nor Apple have said anything about these plans, which means it may never appear.

HealthKit is code Apple makes available to other developers that lets them use the data gathered by the Health app on your iPhone in their apps, in this case, to create workout music.

Your iPhone, compatible fitness tracker, or Apple Watch collect all kinds of information about your fitness. This includes data concerning how much you walk, cycle, run, how long you work out for, how many calories you burn, and so on.

How Spotify could use your Apple Health data

The HealthKit integration will, we think, let Spotify use this information to develop playlists to match those habits – though it will need to obtain your permission to do so.

Messina explains, “This data will allow Spotify to match your workouts with what you listen to and see what audio motivates you best. Workout data includes the type of workout, distance, and pace or speed.”

The idea is that Spotify will be able to choose specific songs for specific exercise routines, personalised to match how you do them. Not everyone exercises at the same speed, and not everyone is motivated by the same tracks, so Spotify will combine what it already knows about your music habits with what it learns about your workout techniques to build these personalised collections.

This could be good news for anyone wanting to listen to music from the service while working off some of the post-Christmas flab.

How to keep your Apple Health data private

When the rumoured news first broke, people were understandably concerned about the implications of sharing their health info with another app. But the fact is that many health and wellness apps and devices already support Apple HealthKit integration, including fitness apps like Nike Run Club, food and nutrition apps like WeightWatchers, and smart medical devices like Withings Blood Pressure Monitor.

They can only harness that info by first asking for your permission, including for the different types of data they require. Per Apple, users could allow an app to read step-count data, for instance, but prevent it from reading blood-glucose levels. You can view and change permissions for the different apps that are using your health data by tapping your profile icon in the Health app and selecting privacy.

In Spotify’s case, it won’t be able to use your health data to serve you ads as Apple’s policy explicitly forbids the use of info from “the HealthKit framework for advertising or similar services”. Neither can companies sell the info they get from HealthKit to third parties, such as advertising platforms.

According to Apple, all HealthKit data is stored locally on your device and encrypted when a user locks their device. It also stays up to date using iCloud, where it is also encrypted “while in transit and at rest.”

In addition, Apple requires all apps that use Health data to provide a privacy policy for users to review before granting permission."
39,"Snohomish County health care leaders shared what they’re concerned about when the federal emergency expires May 11.

EVERETT — After more than three years, the federal COVID public health emergency will end May 11.

The decision will trigger the end of a wide range of temporary waivers and flexibilities in health insurance and health care.

Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett treated the first known COVID patient in the United States. Since then, more than 15,000 Washington residents have died from COVID, including 1,420 in Snohomish County, according to the state Department of Health.

The end of the public health emergency marks a transition to managing COVID as endemic, or a disease that will be consistently present with some predictability.

The Daily Herald asked community leaders to share their key concerns about what this means for Snohomish County residents. As with much of health care, it’s complicated and depends on people’s health insurance or lack thereof.

1. COVID vaccines, testing and treatments could hit patients’ pocketbooks

The county health department flagged this as a particular concern for uninsured or underinsured people.

“We will continue to work toward improving access to vaccines and other healthcare for all residents of Snohomish County, and it will be important to work with impacted communities and healthcare partners on this,” said director Dennis Worsham and health officer Dr. James Lewis in a joint statement.

The health department will continue to update its website with how residents can get vaccine information and shots: snohd.org/covidvaccine

Private insurance will cover vaccines, but they won’t be required to do so when given by out-of-network providers. This is a big change.

And free at-home COVID tests will no longer be guaranteed through insurers or governments, except for Apple Health enrollees.

The Community Health Plan of Washington cautioned that as they work out coverage details for tests, vaccines and treatments, patients should “pay close attention to what kind of insurance they have and what it is now covering,” wrote spokesperson Meg Olberding.

People should call the phone number on the back of their health insurance card for questions about coverage or new processes as May 11 draws closer.

Leaders at Sea Mar Community Health Centers are concerned about the high prices folks could pay for a course of Paxlovid to treat COVID. The federal government has paid over $500 per five-day course of drugs, when buying in bulk. While Apple Health patients won’t pay anything until some time in 2024 at the earliest, folks with private insurance or no insurance might not be able to afford copays or coinsurance.

2. Apple Health, or Medicaid, access

During the federal public health emergency, Apple Health enrollees were guaranteed “continuous enrollment.” The state received extra federal dollars to cover higher enrollment.

Even though the federal government had already announced that states would have to restart Medicaid renewals on April 1, multiple health care leaders raised this as a top concern. As the Herald reported in January, up to 40,000 Snohomish residents might lose Apple Health — some because they are no longer eligible, some because they didn’t fill out paperwork on time.

Leaders from Community Health Plan of Washington and Community Health Center of Snohomish County urged folks with Apple Health or any state health plan, to make sure their insurance plan and the state have their current contact information. And open all mail from insurers, the state and health care providers.

Even so, spokesperson for Sea Mar Community Health Centers Rahab Mugwanja wrote: “Many immigrant and low-income populations have difficulty navigating the recertification and enrollment process for becoming eligible for Medicaid.”

Compass Health provides behavioral health care primarily for Medicaid patients. They expect to help their patients find new health insurance, or re-enroll if they lost Apple Health coverage because of paperwork mistakes or delays.

Tom Sebastian, president and CEO of Compass, wrote, “We will also work to identify grants and alternative funding sources that will enable clients to continue to receive care from their Compass Health team, even if they no longer qualify for Medicaid.”

3. Telehealth

Telehealth is the delivery of services to patients by phone, email or video. Early in the pandemic, the federal government made changes to expand telehealth for Medicare, and states did the same with Medicaid.

Dr. James Cook, chief medical officer at Providence’s Everett hospital, wrote: “We are grateful the Washington Congressional delegation, including Rep. Rick Larsen, extended those telehealth flexibilities.”

Medicare changes will continue through Dec. 31, 2024. Some of the telehealth provisions that apply to providers expire with the end of the public health emergency. This affects patients with private insurance.

Telehealth is one of those complex issues that varies based on public and private insurance plans, as well as provider.

4. Long-term care

Pete Wolkin is the director of operations for Nightingale Healthcare, a company that operates seven skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, two of them in Snohomish County. He flagged decreased funding for community health care providers generally. The operational costs of COVID will continue — such as extra personal protective equipment and precautions — while some government support for it will end.

During the federal public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waived the requirement that patients be admitted to an acute care facility for at least three days before transitioning to a skilled nursing facility. Wolkin said this eased the burden on hospitals and streamlined care delivery for those in need of skilled nursing.

5. The end of the emergency doesn’t mean the end of COVID-19

The health department expects the county will continue to see surges of high transmission or severe illness. At those times, the department will work with the community to call for more prevention measures, such as vaccinations, masking, improved indoor ventilation and staying home when sick. In short, they wrote, “The end of the public health emergency doesn’t mean the end of COVID-19.”

Wolkin, from Nightingale Healthcare, shared the concern: “The public perception that the danger of the pandemic has subsided does not align with the reality of the continued threat that respiratory viruses pose to long-term care settings. Visitors may have less understanding of the continued need to protect staff and residents from infection.”

40,"Last August, Apple sent several of its prototype self-driving cars on a roughly 40-mile trek through Montana. Aerial drones filmed the drive, from Bozeman to the ski resort town of Big Sky, so that Apple managers could produce a polished film, with picturesque mountains in the background, to show CEO Tim Cook how their costly and long-running autonomous car project, Titan, was making progress.

Inside Apple, executives hailed the demonstration as a success. The vehicles showed they could drive without relying on highly detailed, three-dimensional road maps, which most rival self-driving-car programs require. Titan managers hoped to ditch these costly and unscalable high-definition maps en route to one day building and selling a fully automated car that could work almost anywhere in the world without a steering wheel or pedals, making Apple responsible for the car’s behavior and the safety of its occupants.

The good vibes following the Bozeman demo didn’t last long. Apple’s test vehicles, which are modified Lexus SUVs, struggled to navigate streets near its Silicon Valley headquarters without the maps, smacking into curbs and sometimes having trouble staying in their lanes while crossing intersections, according to two people who worked on the program. And earlier this year, a test vehicle nearly hit a jogger who was crossing the street and had the right of way, one of these people said."
41,"Google is also starting to act on complaints received from industry bodies.

Alphabet Inc's Google has been asked by the government and the central bank to introduce more stringent checks to help curb the use of illegal digital lending applications in India, according to sources.

Even though Google doesn't fall under the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) ambit, the U.S. tech giant has been called several times in the last few months to meetings by the central bank and the government and urged to introduce tougher checks and balances that can help in weeding out such apps, according to four sources.

The regulators have already asked lenders to step up checks against illegal lending apps, which became popular during the pandemic. Regulators seek to control the proliferation of such apps that engage in unscrupulous activities such as charging excessive interest rates and fees or in recovery practices which are not authorised by the central bank or violate money laundering and other government guidelines.

Google said that last year it revised its Play Store developer program policy for financial services apps, including requiring additional requirements for personal loan apps in effective September 2021.

""We have removed over 2,000 personal loan apps targeting India from the Play Store for violation of the Play policy requirements,"" a Google spokesperson said, adding that such steps are taken if its policies are violated.

""We will continue to engage with law enforcement agencies and industry bodies to help address this issue,"" the spokesperson added.

While central bank requires that any lending apps listed on app stores be backed by regulated entities, it is up to Google to enforce this and monitor compliance.

Google has also been asked to look at curtailing the rise of such apps via other distribution channels such as websites and other means of downloads, according to another industry source who is directly involved.

Google is also starting to act on complaints received from industry bodies.

""Earlier Google would not respond to complaints on individual apps. Now they are more proactive and do look into it when a complaint is flagged to them,"" said one of the four industry sources directly involved in the matter and who has been briefed about discussions with Google.

The government and the RBI are in the process of preparing a white list of approved lending applications. The central bank has also laid down norms to ensure that a borrower must deal directly with a bank for lending and recovery which can help to keep the third-party recovery agents away.

Google dominates app market with 95% of smartphones using its Android platform.

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the RBI did not immediately respond to an email request seeking comment.

NEW ADVERTISING POLICY

The digital lending market has grown quickly and facilitated $2.2 billion in digital loans in 2021-22. It is not clear how much of that is via apps engaging in illegal practices.

These lenders often reach customers via advertisements on platforms like Facebook and Google.

Starting from next month, Google will roll out a new advertising policy for financial services in India, a blog post on its website shows.

The policy says that in order to show financial services ads in India, advertisers need to be verified in the country. As part of the verification, advertisers must demonstrate that they are licensed with the relevant financial services regulator, the blog says."
42,"Cannabis dispensaries want to be able to advertise their products using the same online channels as every other business and website. However, they’re finding few opportunities to do so as Google, Twitter, and Facebook aren’t budging.

Google, Facebook, and Twitter have all gone on record saying that they will not allow sponsored ads, posts or tweets that promote the purchase or use of marijuana. Yet, cannabis dispensaries like the newly-opened ones in Colorado feel they are entitled to these online marketing resources because their products are legal, which thereby equates them with other local businesses.

There’s one big problem though. While states like Colorado and Washington may have legalized recreational marijuana use, weed is still illegal on the federal level. This may explain why go-to advertising outlets like Google, Facebook and Twitter are refusing to allows sponsored content promoting recreational marijuana use.

Google’s policy on illegal drugs and psychoactive substances states that the search engine does not allow:

…the promotion of illegal drugs, legal or synthetic highs, herbal drugs, chemicals and compounds with psychoactive effects, drug paraphernalia, or aids to pass drug tests.

Likewise, Facebook’s guidelines clearly state:

Ads may not promote or facilitate the sale or consumption of illegal or recreational drugs, tobacco products, or drug or tobacco paraphernalia.

Twitter, too, has a pretty clear cut policy when it comes to promoting drugs through sponsored Tweets, trends or entire Twitter accounts:

Twitter prohibits the promotion of drugs and drug paraphernalia globally.

According to GigaOm, advocates of recreational cannabis use have suggested that online ads be allowed to promote weed and weed paraphernalia, if only in the areas where recreational marijuana use is legal. However, Facebook, Twitter and Google have all rejected geo-targeted pot ads, although they did say that they will continue to review their advertising policies.

The issue of advertising marijuana products online is a complex one, to say the least. The matter is further complicated by Google’s $240,000 grant to the cannabis group Michigan Compassion in June of 2013 and by language loopholes referenced by Adweek that don’t trigger red flags on Google and Facebook.

Despite their willingness to review their advertising policies, it’s highly unlikely that Facebook, Google, or Twitter will be allowing ads for weed anytime soon."
43,"A teacher put her teenage son in the trunk of her car because she did not want to catch COVID-19 from him while driving, according to authorities in Houston, Texas. Sarah Hadassah Beam, 41, was taking him to get tested again, officers said.

According to Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District police, a health official was at Pridgeon Stadium on Monday receiving information from vehicles in line for COVID-19 testing. Beam was there, officers said. She said her 13-year-old boy tested positive for COVID-19, and she put him in the trunk to keep her from getting exposed to the virus while driving him for more testing, according to this version of events.

“Witness stated that when she requested to see the child (K.H.), defendant had to unlatch the trunk of the vehicle in which the child was lying down inside the trunk,” officers said.

The official said Beam would not get COVID-19 testing until the boy went to the back seat.

An police officer said he used surveillance cameras from a nearby middle school to find that the boy did leave the car trunk and entered the back seat on the passenger side.

Beam is a teacher for the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District.

“CFPD was alerted that a child was in the trunk of a car at a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site earlier this week,” the school district wrote in a statement obtained by KPRC. “Law enforcement conducted a full investigation, resulting in a warrant for arrest. Thankfully, the child was not harmed.”

Beam is reportedly on administrative leave. She faces a count of endangering a child. She made bond at $1,500 and has no attorney of record.

Apple’s top-of-the-line computer will be assembled in Texas, the company announced Monday, a manufacturing decision that got caught up in the trade war with China. The Lone Star State can thank new tariff exemptions for Apple’s move. President Trump has been pushing Apple, which makes the vast majority of its products in China, to build them in the United States. “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!” he tweeted in July.

Over the weekend, the administration exempted certain Chinese-made components used in the Mac Pro from tariffs. In a statement, Apple chief executive Tim Cook thanked the administration for the exemption, which allows the company to assemble the computer inside the United States.

“We believe deeply in the power of American innovation,” Cook said in the statement. “That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”

The news is the latest twist in the trade-war saga for Apple, which has seen its stock price fluctuate wildly with Trump’s tweets about his negotiations with China. Many of Apple’s products, including its iPhone, are expected to see new restrictions in December unless a deal with China is announced.

While many of the components in the Mac Pro still come from China, keeping the assembly in the United States could be a public relations win for the president.

Still, the Mac Pro is a niche product compared with the iPhone, the iPad, laptops and watches. The lowest-end Mac Pro starts at about $6,000, and the high-end versions, with 28-core processors, could run upward of $35,000, about the price of a Tesla Model 3 electric car. That puts the computer far outside the price range of most consumers, making it a tool mostly for businesses that require vast computing power.

The previous version of the Mac Pro, which launched six years ago and was recently discontinued, was also built in the same Flextronics plant in Austin. That model, a small black cylinder, ran into production problems, some of which Apple attributed to the device’s thermal design.

The news Monday doesn’t signal the beginning of a broader shift to U.S. manufacturing for Apple. Labor in China is still significantly cheaper, and China has built infrastructure to service big U.S. companies. But for extremely expensive, niche products like the Mac Pro, U.S. assembly makes more sense, analysts say. It would be much more difficult to move iPhone assembly to the U.S., analysts say.

Had Apple moved its Mac Pro assembly to China, it might have faced a tariff on the entire computer. Apple will have to pay a 15 percent tariff on its iPhone, for instance, in December. But the special exemption of some components, such as circuit boards, may have changed Apple’s calculus. It is also in line with the desires of President Trump, who has the power to make changes to tariffs on a dime and without oversight.

Apple’s move to Texas “doesn’t represent a shift in the mindset or a shift in momentum towards computer and electronics manufacturing tin the United States,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. He said U.S. companies still have tax incentives to shift manufacturing overseas, and China’s lax environmental and labor rights laws keep costs low. “Over the longer term we’re going to need much broader policy shifts to keep American high tech manufacturing jobs here,” he said.

Chad Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, a nonprofit think tank, said that special treatment for some companies like Apple could hurt other U.S. outfits, allowing the White House to anoint winners and losers. The Trump administration has “turned this into an unfair playing field, where it’s all about who you know,” he said. “That’s a big difference from how the U.S. has historically conducted its trade policy,” he said.

45,"A New York college student filed a lawsuit against Apple for $1 billion, claiming the company's alleged use of facial recognition software in its stores falsely linked him to a series of Apple store thefts.

Ousmane Bah, 18, claims that he received a summons from a court in Boston saying that he stole $1,200 worth of Apple products in 2018, according to papers filed on Monday in Manhattan federal court.

The products included Apple Pencils, which retail for $99 each.

On the day of one of the thefts in Boston, Bah was attending his senior prom in Manhattan, according to the court documents. The suit claims Bah was also falsely blamed for Apple store robberies in Delaware, New Jersey and Manhattan.

Bah says someone must have used his lost ID to pretend they were him after they got caught stealing merchandise from Apple. The college student believes that the iPhone giant accepted the identification and then programmed its security systems to recognize the perpetrator’s face as Bah’s.

The teen's life has been ""deeply and negatively affected,"" according to the lawsuit. ""He advanced through his freshman year of college experiencing constant anxiety and fear that at any moment he would be arrested again for a crime he did not commit.""

The complaint said that Bah was ""forced to respond to multiple false allegations,"" which lead to ""severe stress and hardship.""

47,"Today, the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), a coalition that includes Apple opposition players such as Epic Games, Spotify and others, released a pair of new polls - a national battleground survey and a California statewide - that found likely voters in both political parties back legislation to address the anticompetitive practices of app store gatekeepers. The polls were conducted by Republican and Democratic firms.

The battleground survey included Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This survey found that 68% of voters think Big Tech has too much power and 79% support efforts by Congress to pass the Open App Markets Act and open up the mobile app ecosystem to competition. In the California statewide survey, polling showed that 69% of likely California voters believe Big Tech has too much power and 75% support the Open App Markets Act.

Rick VanMeter, Executive Director for the Coalition for App Fairness: “The numbers don’t lie - voters across the country overwhelmingly want their members of Congress to stop Big Tech’s anticompetitive practices. Voters have made clear that they want flexibility and choice in how they access apps on their mobile devices. These findings demonstrate that reining in mobile app store gatekeepers by passing the Open App Markets Act is a winning issue for Republicans and Democrats alike. Congress has a simple choice: side with Big Tech or support the American people.”

The Open App Markets Act, would fix the broken mobile app marketplace by requiring mobile gatekeepers to allow third party app stores and third party in-app payment systems. Additionally, the legislation prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as “self-preferencing,” by banning app stores from engaging in behaviors that put their products at an advantage over independent developers and competitors.

Key Findings of the Battleground Survey Include:

79% of likely voters support the Open App Markets Act

68% of likely voters say Big Tech has too much power

59% of likely voters say Apple has too much power

67% of likely voters say Google has too much power

72% agree “Big Tech companies, like Apple and Google, limit competition and restrict innovation from independent app developers”

72% of likely voters support the American Innovation and Choice Online Act

61% of likely voters say they would feel more favorable toward their members of Congress or Senator for supporting this bill

Key findings of the California survey include:

75% of California voters support the Open App Markets Act with 50% saying they strongly support the bill

62% of California voters disapprove of the job that Congress has done with regards to regulating Big Tech companies

Methodology:

On behalf of the Coalition for App Fairness, OnMessage Public Strategies fielded calls in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin between June 4-10, N=1600 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/-2.5%.

On behalf of the Coalition for App Fairness, Lake Research Partners designed and administered a California statewide phone survey, conducted from June 1 to June 12, 2022. The survey reached 800 California likely 2022 voters statewide.

The Coalition for App Fairness appears to frustrated with Senator Klobuchar’s inability to bring antitrust proposals to Congress for a vote before the mid-term elections. A Republican held congress would likely lessen the bill’s attack on Apple and Google App Stores and refocus on another agenda about diminishing social media’s overall power in the U.S.

On June 4, Patently Apple posted a report titled “Apple’s lobbying against a Proposed Antitrust Bill has so far seemed to be the most persuasive to lawmakers with lingering concerns about the legislation.”

In that report, Jesse Lehrich, co-founder of Accountable Tech stated that Apple’s lobbying has so far seemed to be the most persuasive to lawmakers with lingering concerns about the legislation, in part because it’s maintained a greater sense of credibility in Washington than some of its peers.

Many believe that the members of the The Coalition for App Fairness is simply trying to break Apple’s App Store rules so that industry players such of Epic and Meta could build Metaverse app stores on a platform that Apple created and bypass rgw tough security and privacy standards that Apple is famous for."
48,"Lee Dunn was recently named the head of White House strategy and outreach at Google. Before that, she was the head of Google’s Republican Elections team, which works to help Republican candidates devise and implement their online strategies. She previously worked for almost a decade as a top aide for Senator John McCain, including during his 2008 presidential campaign as well as his 2010 reelection to the Senate. Previously, she served as a clerk for a federal judge and has worked for a telecommunications law firm.

Will Google’s lobbying and outreach strategy have to change with the new administration?

We first opened the DC office when Bush was in office and then we had eight years with the Obama administration, so I think we’ve seen two different types of administrations. We really grew as a company in our outreach during the Obama years. But I think that we won’t really change much. We have some core issues that we’ve always stood for, such as freedom of expression, fair use and copyright and others. The issues don’t change and your policy positions don’t change, but sometimes the relationships and the personnel you need do have to change. And you also might change which issues you advocate most for. Priorities held for a Democratic administration might change for a Republican administration. You look to find which policies we agree on and help the administration with those policies.

Have you ever found it challenging to be a Republican working in a company that is often thought to be quite liberal?

It can present a challenge, but you just have to rise to that challenge. And really, I think Google actually is more libertarian than polarizing on either side. The founders and most of the employees just want to succeed in making really good products without an overreaching regulatory environment. So we just look to see what we can do to find agreement with any administration to grow our products and our user base and to be more innovative.

What role do you think digital advertising played in the 2016 election?

Digital advertising played more of a role in the 2016 election than ever before, which is really exciting. But as an industry the elections business is still behind where corporate America is. In 2016, corporate America spent half their money on digital advertising, and the other half on television advertising. In the elections world, however, TV has a very emotional pull for many candidates. They want to see themselves on TV. A lot of candidates also tend to be older TV watchers themselves, so it’s a medium that they are comfortable with and they’ve used for their last election. Most candidates cannot imagine the changes that have happened since the last election cycle in the advertising business. It’s also challenging because most advertising agencies don’t have to re-educate their client every four or six years, but that’s exactly what elections agencies have to do. I think the elections industry will catch up to where corporate America is in terms of online spending eventually, but we did already see a big move towards that this year.

What things did Republican candidates do particularly well with regards to digital advertising this election cycle?

Republican candidates – especially on the Senate side – spent more online than ever before and also tended to spend online earlier. I think that really helped them this cycle to find voters and tell their story. We learned a lot from the Trump campaign – they didn’t make assumptions about their voters. They didn’t look too narrowly. They looked to find people online that could be persuaded to think about Trump as their choice and worked to make sure that they were the ones to turn out to vote.

Can you think of any particularly successful moments for Republican candidates from a digital standpoint?

One of the things that I think stood out were campaigns that defined their campaign opponent early on using Google search ads. For example, the Todd Young for Senate race and the Rob Portman for Senate race both went up on search very early defining their opponents as the lesser choice. I think that made a huge difference. I think also the fact that Trump was the most searched candidate on Google almost every day of the election showed that there was this online interest in the candidate, and they used that to their advantage. I thought the level of search interest in Trump would level off… and it just never dissipated. And I think part of the reason that happened is because the candidate continued to say or do things that were intriguing to people, so that level of interest just never waned.

What should candidates running in 2018 and beyond take away from the 2016 election cycle?

We’ve been talking to candidates for 2018 about the big lessons we’ve learned. First, go early. Sixty percent of the total search queries involving the election occurred before the end of July. Starting early, and it doesn’t need to be with a lot of money, can really benefit a candidate. Second, going with bigger digital budgets is really important. Americans spend twice as much time online than watching television, and your advertising budget should reflect that. And third, we learned that frequency of ads is key to ensure that you stay top of mind to a voter. It’s crucial to reach that right level of frequency so your ads aren’t lost in all the clutter in a voter’s life and online."
49,"Name three current smartphones that arrive with a stylus in the box. Odds are there’s only one that jumps to mind — Samsung’s Galaxy Note, of which we’re on the tenth version. Just for the record, LG also makes a stylus-toting smartphone. It’s just a mission to obtain in South Africa. The point, though, is that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 (and the Galaxy Note 10 Plus we’re testing here) is the phone of choice for a surprisingly large number of people.

As far as phone hardware goes, the Note 10 Plus is pretty unique. We’re not seeing Xiaomi or Huawei or OnePlus creating clones of Samsung’s Note series. Apple hasn’t come out with an iPhone Stylus Edition. LG’s attempting to get a seat at the table but… well, we saw how that’s working out in the first paragraph. You didn’t know their stylus-phones existed, remember? Long story short, Samsung has a built-in market for their annual, oversized, tech-packed smartphone. Note fans are gonna buy it, because it’s the only Note in town — no matter what Xiaomi wants you to think. Samsung, technically, doesn’t have to try any more. Has that made the South Korean company’s grip slip? Let’s find out, shall we?

We miss the flat Note

Samsung’s devices have been recognisable as hell of late. From the launch of the S8 and its Infinity Display right up to the present day, you can tell that the phone you’re holding belongs to Samsung. Actually it belongs to you (hopefully) but Samsung made the freaking thing. Which is all fine and dandy but telling the S8, S9, and S10 apart is a little more difficult to do. The same thing applies with this year’s Note 10 Plus. It’s easy to tell that Samsung’s made it but where it fits in the hierarchy is a little less clear at a glance.

And that’s because the S-series design language is fully evident here. Samsung’s gone for a curved glass front and back, just like the S-series flagships. We’re not fans, for two reasons. You already know the first one — if not for the Note 10 Plus’ 6.8in size, it’s pretty easy to mistake for most recent Samsung flagships. And if you’re not going by size, you’ll have to pay attention to the physical buttons available (fewer than usual — just power and volume) or the bottom-right S Pen port to make sure it’s a real Note. And the other reason we’re not thrilled is the S Pen. Samsung’s Note series stands out because of the stylus but the curved screen leads to some… slippage. A flat front panel would have made S Pen shenanigans even easier to execute than they are at present. The Dynamic AMOLED screen is mighty pretty. It’s just not wholly practical.

Pretty on the inside

Samsung’s high-end handset isn’t just a pretty face, though. The most powerful smartphone in Samsung’s stable — but not the most powerful device on the market today — the Galaxy Note 10 Plus combines the company’s own Exynos 9825 processor with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That’s before you augment internal space with a microSD, but you’re probably not going to do that. Unless you take photos incessantly, that is. There’s a 4,300mAh battery in the handset which keeps it up all day (and at least part of the evening). With heavy use you’ll be returning to the charger daily but you might squeeze almost two days of uptime out if you’re not streaming a whole bunch.

The 6.8in (1,440 x 3,040) display is one of the items that sets the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus apart from the stock Note 10 (which has a 6.3in 1,080 x 2,280 Dynamic AMOLED screen, instead). The other differences? The stock Note 10 only has 8GB of RAM and no 512GB edition. It’s rocking a smaller 3,500mAh battery but the camera tech is identical across both devices. And both are lacking a 3.5mm headphone port, so much for using your old cans. At least Samsung provides some wired USB-C AKG earbuds in the box. And a plastics clear case — it’d be an awful shame if we were to kill yet another Samsung flagship by dropping it, after all.

Plus, you know, the S Pen. More on that in a bit.

Numbers may lie (but these don’t)

Samsung’s latest is also its greatest. Android 9 Pie running on Samsung’s One UI with this set of hardware is quick. Very, very quick. In fact, we didn’t see evidence of slowdown anywhere during our review period. Games, multiple apps, streaming Spotify while playing a game, mucking around the stylus and camera… the slowdown isn’t visible to the naked eye. We could’ve just kept loading apps till the 12GB of RAM gave out but we ran out of apps first. So it was off to the benchmarking software to see whether they had anything to say.

This time around we used Geekbench 5, Antutu, and 3D Mark’s Slingshot Extreme graphics test — smartphone testing is looking more and more like the heyday of PC benchmarking. The numbers were, expectedly, impressive. A run through Geekbench 5 popped out a single-core score of 824 and a multi-core core of 2,252 — the latter of which seemed a little low to us. The single-core numbers put this device above the S10 in terms of power, while the S10 edges it out in terms of multi-core numbers.

Antutu returned a score of 349,134 – those numbers are no slouch at all. It puts the Note 10 Plus in the region of the top most powerful devices on the planet. The phones that beat it? Dedicated gaming phones like the ROG Phone 2 and Xiaomi’s Mi Blackshark 2, among other power-devices. A brief trip to 3DMark-Land and we returned with scores in the region of 4,900 for Slingshot Extreme. Specifically, 4960 for OpenGL ES 3.1 and 4890 for Vulkan. Those numbers put the Note 10 Plus in the top 2% of mobile devices, in terms of graphics processing.

Get it right on the night"
50,"Most of us will experience bloating at some point in our lives. Michele O’Connor explores common causes – and explains what we can do about them.

Common causes for tummy bloating and what you can do to try and stop the symptoms

Tight waistband after eating certain foods?

Tummy gets bigger as the day goes on? You’re not alone.

Here is what you can do about it.

Eating on the run

If you hurtle out the door with toast in hand then wolf down a lunchtime sandwich at your desk, you’re probably swallowing air with your food, warns Suzie Sawyer, clinical nutritionist ( feelaliveuk.com).



“Instead of entering our lungs, some of that air goes into our oesophagus, then into our stomach, and eventually into our intestines and colon, triggering bloating.” Ideally, take your time and sit down to eat with no distractions.



Aim to chew a mouthful around 30 times before swallowing.

Fizzy drinks

Carbonated drinks contain carbon dioxide and the gas can puff out your stomach, explains Suzie.

Artificial sweeteners in diet drinks simply add to the problem because they can be hard for many of us to digest.

“Still water is the best go-to beverage, while black, green or herbal teas are good for digestion,” she says. And when you’re out in the evening, try red wine or kombucha instead of beer or cider. They both contain compounds that boost good gut bacteria and alleviate bloating.

Your period

Many women suffer bloating just before their period begins and during it.

“As well as causing menstrual bleeding, research suggests that changes in progesterone and oestrogen levels cause the body to retain more water and salt,” explains Suzie.

“As a result, the body’s cells become swollen with water, causing the feeling of bloating.”

Combat this by avoiding salty food and refined carbohydrates (white flour and processed sugar) and fill up on potassium-rich foods such as spinach, sweet potato, bananas, avocados and tomatoes.”

Lactose intolerance

Some people lack the enzyme necessary to digest lactose, the sugar in cows’ milk. As a result the lactose ferments in the colon, producing large amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen which may cause gas and abdominal cramps.

Try cutting out all dairy for a week and use milk alternatives to see if things improve.

Constipation

“The longer your stool stays in your colon, the more gas and bloating you get,” explains Suzie.

“Slowly increase your fibre intake to add bulk to your stool, making it easier to pass. Be warned though, if you add too much too quickly, bloating can get worse.”

Drinking more water and taking regular exercise will also keep your bowels moving, while twisting from side-to-side can help reduce any gas that has built up in the digestive tract, she advises.

If lifestyle measures don’t work, talk to a pharmacist about a stool softener or gentle laxative as a short-term measure. If problems persist, see your GP.

IBS

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition of the digestive system that can cause bloating, alongside cramps, diarrhoea and constipation.

“There’s a theory that IBS causes a problem with bacteria in the gut and this, in turn, can create toxins that may cause excessive gas,” says Suzie.

“Another theory is that the guts of people with IBS are less able to tolerate and transport gas.”

Try keeping a food diary to identify trigger foods (onions and garlic are common triggers) and Google low-FODMAP diets.

Eat small, regular meals and set aside 30 minutes to eat in order to ‘digest’ your meal, she adds.

Consider a probiotic supplement that survives the stomach acid. Massaging the abdomen from left to right in circular motions also can help, while drinking peppermint tea can relieve trapped wind.

Fructose

A small Spanish study found that 72 per cent of patients with abdominal bloating had some form of sugar malabsorption. The most common culprit is fructose – a natural sugar found in fruit, honey and in highly processed food.

“Fructose is usually absorbed in the small intestine, but for those with fructose intolerance, some travels to the colon where bacteria ferment the fructose,” explains Suzie.

“This causes the release of hydrogen and methane gases, which cause pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea.”

Eliminate high-fructose foods, such as fizzy drinks, certain cereal bars and fruits (such as prunes, pears, cherries, peaches, apples, plums and watermelon), apple juice and apple cider, pear juice, sugar snap peas, honey, ice cream, chocolate and biscuits containing fructose sweeteners.

When patients in the study did this, 81 per cent reported improvements in bloating symptoms after a month. (Don’t rely on sugar-free alternatives as they often contain ingredients which can make bloating worse).

Coeliac disease

This is an auto-immune condition where eating gluten causes the immune system to attack its own tissues, damaging the small intestine so it is unable to absorb nutrients and causes gas and bloating.

Following a gluten-free diet – even if you have mild symptoms – should provide relief and also prevent the long-term complications of the condition.

“Try ginger tea or ginger ale to settle the stomach and help stop the cramping,” says Suzie.

Medication

Drugs known to cause flatulence and bloating include certain laxatives, antacids, antibiotics, antidepressants, statins, and some drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes.

A few women taking the contraceptive pill experience fluid retention as a side effect.

“Watch out for multivitamin brands that contain sugars and ingredients that some people cannot completely digest, which can cause excess gas and bloating,” warns Suzie.

Speak to your doctor and see if your medication can be adjusted.

PCOS

Changing hormones can cause fluid retention and digestive imbalance so, not only is bloating common when we menstruate, it affects menopausal women and those with endometriosis and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.

A study by women’s health app Flo found that bloating was the disorder’s most common symptom, experienced by around 77 per cent of sufferers.

“PCOS bloating can be made worse by foods with a carbohydrate called raffinose, causing more gas production,” says Suzie.

“Being aware of trigger foods can help reduce your abdominal pain,” she explains.

Examples include asparagus, beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower. Exercise can help by balancing hormones and controlling blood sugar levels."
51,"Sarah Kaeck, CEO of Bee's Wrap.

by Joyce Marcel, Vermont Business Magazine

In a little building by the train tracks in Middlebury, the war against plastics is being profitably waged, one hunk of beeswax at a time.

Plastics, as we now recognize, are devastating to the environment.

“Studies have detected plastic fibers everywhere—in the stomachs of sperm whales, in tap water and in table salt,” said a recent story in the Irish Times, although it could have appeared anywhere. (Google “plastics” and get about 4,290,000,000 results in 0.71 seconds) “A researcher in Britain says plastic may help define the most recent layer of the earth’s crust because it takes so long to break down and there is so much of it.”

Vermont is fighting back, and hard. The town of Brattleboro has banned supermarket-style plastic bags for two years now, and the State of Vermont recently joined the growing list of states legislating against single-use plastics (shopping bags, straws, drink stirrers and foam food packaging, for example). The new law will take effect in July of 2020.

If Vermont had a sea, as it did at the end of the Ice Age, its sea turtles would be cheering right now.

Which brings me back to the Vermont entrepreneur who has been taking major steps to eliminate at least one kind of plastic: the kind in which we wrap our leftovers.

Meet Sarah Kaeck, 44, a tall, slender, bubbly, breathless and instantly likable woman who has a great smile; she is the founder and CEO of Bee's Wrap.

Kaeck uses bespoke machines to infuse an elegantly printed organic cotton cloth from Indonesia with just the right amount of beeswax, tree resin and jojoba oil to make it safe and pliable.

Sold as “sustainable food storage,” the large wraps, printed with the company's honeycomb pattern trademark, keep bread crusty and fresh for a week; smaller ones, decorated with happily swimming turtles and blue bears, cover leftovers.

“We wanted to reduce the amount of plastic we use in the kitchen for food storage, for the health of our family and the environment,” Kaeck said.

Because the product was new to the public, its name was of primary importance.

“It took a lot of educating to get people to understand what this wax wrap was for,” Kaeck said. “And to explain why you would use this instead of plastic wrap. I felt like I needed a name that was in some way descriptive, and something that everyone could relate to. Hence Bee's Wrap.”

The wraps are pretty, reusable, compostable, biodegradable, waterproof, airtight, and hand-washable. They fold flat and are long-lasting. They are endorsed by Rachel Ray and sealed by the warmth of your hand.

Kaeck, who lives on a farm in New Haven with her husband and three children, cooked up the Bee's Wrap idea in her kitchen and started selling it online through blogs in 2011.

Talk about hitting the zeitgeist! Zing! The company has grown over 80 percent in the past two years. Bee's Wrap, a B Corporation, now employs 40 people; in the next few months Kaeck is bringing in two upper management professionals to help her further grow the company.

“We're bringing on a CFO who starts on Monday,” Kaeck said. “And we're bringing on a director of marketing and commerce. She starts a week from Monday. So we're bringing in some senior leadership right now which is super exciting. It's a big change.”

At its start, the company had help from the Vermont Small Business Development Center.

“I first met Sarah Kaeck in January of 2013,” said VtSBDC's statewide advisor, Sarah Kearns. “It was clear from the very start that she was creative, hard-working and really smart. She saw a solution to a problem and even in the early years, I think she knew it could have huge potential. She was a wonderful client for us, as she was always open to ideas and very thoughtful about her next steps. VtSBDC feels a tremendous sense of pride for our small part in her success. She has always embodied her brand and she is doing her part to solve a huge problem. She is a change-maker for sure. I will never forget those first meetings in her kitchen, when her shop was in her garage! She is a true Vermont story that we can all feel good about.”

Bee's Wrap products are sold in more than 3,000 stores in the US, including Amazon, of course, and natural food chains like Natural Grocers, national home stores like Anthropologie, and big kitchen chains like Sur La Table, as well as in 41 countries in Europe, South America and Asia.

How did a tiny company located in the middle of Vermont reach markets in Europe and Asia?

“Well, I had distributors,” Kaeck said. “Two women, one in Norway and one in the Netherlands, reached out to me separately to ask if they could distribute these wraps in their countries. They were just starting, like I was just starting. So I said, 'Sure, let's give it a shot.' And they've grown their companies as I've grown mine. We've developed great relationships. And from there we've expanded to other places. We did a trade show in London a few years ago and took on a partnership with a distributor there. So by doing some of these overseas trade shows we've made connections in South Africa, South America and Asia.”

While Kaeck said she was uncomfortable providing a sales figure, she acknowledged that yearly revenue now falls between $5 million and $10 million. This winter, to keep up with demand, the company moved from a small manufacturing plant in Bristol to a 12,000-square-foot industrial space in Middlebury.

The company has partnership arrangements with National Geographic and Patagonia.

“We do a co-branding partnership with National Geographic,” Kaeck said. “This was for the launch of their Plastic Awareness Campaign a little over a year ago. They brought on some supporting products to help people attain that plastic-free kitchen on the go, and Bee's Wrap is one of those products. We're pretty psyched to be a part of that company. We also do a co-branding partnership with Patagonia Provisions, which is part of Patagonia. They sell a number of different products based around food, like smoked salmon and muesli for backpacking. The wraps are great for backpacking and it's zero waste. My husband likes them for hunting because it has a natural scent and it doesn't make noise when you open it.”

Bee's Wrap also makes a great fire starter. Trimmings from the manufacturing process are regularly put out back of the plant for local people to use as starters for campfires and wood stoves.

Bee's Wraps aren't cheap; a single sandwich wrap costs $11 and the one large enough to keep a loaf of good bread fresh costs $15. But they are reusable for at least a year — and probably much longer.

Bee's Wrap products have been featured in a multitude of magazines, including The Boston Globe, Cooks, HuffPo, O, Eating Well, Real Simple and Fox News.

The on-line news service BuzzFeed did a video about Bee's Wrap, calling it “an eco-alternative to plastic wraps.” The video (beeswrap.com/pages/press) went viral.

Kaeck has built her company without investors and cannot imagine taking it public.

“We've grown organically the whole way,” Kaeck said. “No outside funding. Never.”

But the company does have a line of credit from the National Bank of Middlebury. When Kaeck won the US Small Business Administration Award for Vermont's Woman-Owned Business of the Year in 2017, her bank proudly posted congratulations on its web site:

“Back in 2007, Sarah opened personal deposit accounts with NBM,” the bank said. “Shortly after she opened her business Bee’s Wrap, she established a business checking account and an operating line of credit. NBM is very happy to be part of Sarah’s highly successful, innovative business. As this wonderful company has grown, we have been able to support Sarah’s borrowing needs and to provide electronic banking services like eCorp to assist in management areas.”

This year the company won Green America's People and Planet Award. Green America “provides the economic strategies, organizing power and practical tools for businesses and individuals to solve today's social and environmental problems,” according to its web site.

Early Years

Kaeck comes by her entrepreneurial genes naturally. She grew up in Lancaster, PA, where her father makes and distributes big compost tumblers. Her mother sold a line of high-end clothing.

“She sold them out of the house in the beginning, and then she had a studio,” Kaeck said. “So I grew up around that atmosphere.”

The entrepreneurial instinct displayed itself early.

“My younger brother did the paper route, and I babysat,” Kaeck said. “Then I was a waitress. I worked in a small shop in town. In college I worked at the Apple store.”

Kaeck went to American University in Washington, DC, where she took a degree in women's studies and art. After college she decided to travel. She went out West, moved to Seattle and ended up in Alaska.

“I spent a few years there, and that's where I met my husband,” Kaeck said. “I was working in an art gallery and then on an organic farm. We had our first two kids there. And then my husband and I moved back to Montana.”

Kaeck's husband, Brian Kaeck, a contractor, sells and sets tiles. He also helps with Bee's Wrap’s trade shows.

“He is also a trained chef, and we've always raised a good portion of our food,” Kaeck said. “He hunts deer and elk. And in Montana he foraged for mushrooms. At one point, when we lived in Montana, he purchased and sold wild mushrooms to the East Coast. Mushrooms are the most perishable thing, so shipping them long distance was pretty stressful. Food has been always been a big part of our lives.”

The family moved to Vermont 13 years ago.

“Vermont was a way to get back East, closer to my family,” Kaeck said. “And we could still be in the mountains so we could ski and do the other things we like to do. And at that time I was staying home with my two children. Then I had a third child, a few years after we moved here.”

Her children are now nine, 13 and 16.

“So when we moved back East to Vermont, we had some land,” Kaeck said. “We raised all kinds of animals. We had pigs and sheep and chickens for both eggs and meat and we had goats. We didn't have the goats for too long. But I did milk them and make cheese. We grew a lot of our vegetables. I canned and froze them. We still do grow vegetables, but we've pared way back with both of us being busy in our work and our kids getting bigger and doing things.”

The Big Idea

Even though she was busy being a mother and a farmer, Kaeck's entrepreneurial nerves were twitching. She started doing email marketing for her father's business. Then she began a blog. She did some sewing, mainly making aprons to sell at local farmers' markets.

Then her cousins told her about using waxed fabric for food storage.

“They really encouraged me to try it, thinking that it fit in well with my lifestyle,” Kaeck said. “I bake all of our bread, and anyone who makes bread knows that it's hard to store it. Plastic bags don't keep the crust nice. And if you don't eat it right away, you know you've got to figure out a way to keep it fresh. So this seems like a great solution.”

Environmental consciousness is a big part of Kaeck's family's life.

“Both my husband and I spend a lot of time outdoors and in the woods,” Kaeck said. “So not using plastics was important to us. I started playing around with wax and cotton. Then I figured out a way to make a really nice waxed wrap which worked really well for storing bread. It worked well for covering a bowl. it worked well for everything — veggies and sandwiches and cheese. So I thought I would try selling it. I made a web site, made the honeycomb logo, figured out some packaging and started making wraps.”

She launched the company in October of 2011.

“Then I started reaching out to different blogs with the new idea,” Kaeck said. “People were interested in it because it was new and different and interesting. It was something they could write about. I sent them photos and it just started to take off.”

Soon Kaeck needed help, so she asked a friend to work with her making the wraps.

“We worked in a little studio space off our kitchen,” Kaeck said. “She's a farmer, so she was free in the winter. Then it grew and I hired another friend. And these were all moms from my community. They were my social network. Then, after the first eight months, it necessitated a bigger space.”

With her husband's help, she turned her basement — it had an outdoor entrance — into a workable manufacturing space; she started production there.

“And it grew and grew, so that I had sometimes six or eight women working in that space to produce enough wraps for the demand,” Kaeck said. “So we started selling wholesale, to retailers. Early on we had some great enquiries. Williams-Sonoma was one of our first big customers. We had inquiries from Patagonia. It was super exciting.”

All About Bees

From the beginning, sustainability has been a vital part of the enterprise. Kaeck was drawn to beeswax because it's renewable, fully biodegradable, and has natural antibacterial properties, which makes it ideal for keeping food fresh.

Bees exist in all types of climates around the world. Their products have ancient uses; honey, for example, has a long history as a medicine used for burns and other skin diseases. A mixture of honey, beeswax and olive oil inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus, for example.

Sarah Kaeck with a whole bunch of bee's wax.

“Beeswax is the substance that forms the structure of a honeycomb; the bees secrete wax to build the honeycombs to store honey,” wrote three Italian scientists in a paper reviewed on PubMed. (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633295(link is external))

“Thanks to its rich hydrophobic protective properties, the beeswax is in fact present within cosmetics and body products. Also, beeswax is used in the food industry: as a film to wrap cheese for maturing or as a food additive (E901) to give shine to the products. Exactly as the honey which it contains, beeswax is also characterized by several therapeutic properties of great interest to us; it is thought to be particularly effective in healing bruises, inflammation and burns. Recently, the interest of researchers has moved even on antimicrobial properties of beeswax... the few studies showed an anti-microbic effectiveness of beeswax against overall Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger; these inhibitory effects are enhanced synergistically with other natural products such as honey or olive oil.”

In recent years, we have learned much about the fragility of bee colonies and the mysterious disease called colony collapse disorder. On average, the national decline in bee population is figured at between 30 and 40 percent.

For Kaeck, Bee's Wrap is a way to support pollinators and responsible beekeepers. One way she does this is by partnering with an educational nonprofit in Charlestown, SC, called Bee Cause.

Tami Enright is the executive director of the Bee Cause project, which provides $2,000 grants for bee education and hives to schools, libraries, 4-H clubs and other environmentally aware organizations — usually by getting kids “up close and personal with a hive of honeybees,” she said.

“When kids start learning and taking care of the hive, they start caring about the bees,” Enright said. “We want to connect those kids back to the natural world. We want them to know where their food comes from, how their own actions can support or hurt pollinators. We have 500 schools now that we've donated these grants to, and each has started a different conversation and launch some kind of environmental program and raised awareness. ”

Kaeck contributes both money and products to the project. Bee's Wrap’s primary contribution, Enright said, is making a statement that bees are important.

It turns out, Enright said, that no one actually knows why hives collapse, but scientists think it's a combination of pesticides, habitat decrease and lack of diversity in the bees' diet.

“Scientists have figured out that it's everything, like the cancer in the human body,” Enright said. “We don't know why it happens. We're mowing everything down, landscaping lawns, getting rid of all of the natural habitat. We're also putting chemicals on our lawns that can lessen bee's immune systems. It really is a combination of a lot of different factors.”

Kaeck is a natural partner for Bee Cause.

“We're both telling a story about the importance of honeybees,” Enright said. “Sarah's able to sell her Bee's Wrap and not only talk about the bee's story but the plastic pollution story. She donates her Bee's Wraps to all the schools that get our grant. She sponsors several schools every year. She and I are kindred spirits. She wanted to make the world a better place for her children and put her money where her mouth is. She's walking the walk. We're both carrying a message to the next generation in the hope we can strengthen the connection between our kids and the natural world.”

The grant process begins again this month, and Kaeck will be sponsoring more schools in Vermont. To learn how to apply for a grant, go to www.thebeecause.org/index.php/about-us(link is external)

Mind Your Beeswax

Another way Kaeck helps the bees is by ensuring that the beeswax she uses is sourced responsibly.

The company works hard to ensure that beekeepers keep their hives away from areas of high pesticide use, like golf courses or non-organic farms; this helps prevent the accumulation of pesticides and herbicides in the wax, while also protecting the bees from the dangers of pesticides and herbicides.

The company also works with beekeepers who leave enough honey in the hives to allow bees to overwinter comfortably.

Beeswax comes with its own problems, though.

“It's what we expect to smell, a very sweet scent,” Kaeck said. “In the beginning, we were sourcing all of our beeswax in the US. We still source a lot of it in the US and we're very particular about the beekeepers that we source from. We have a criteria that they practice sustainable beekeeping practices. That the bees aren't traveling back and forth across the US. That there aren't pesticides used in the hives. We have a lengthy list of requirements. That was what we sourced on.”

However, at first they didn't source on scent.

“We brought in a ton of wax and started using it, and it had an incredibly strong scent — which I loved,” Kaeck said. “It came from the Southwest and it had a very resin-y, piney scent. And our customers did not like it. But by the time that product was made, was on the shelf and shipped to the customers, time had passed. We had made a lot of it. We ended up catching it fairly early on, but there were a lot of complaints about the smell. People would say, 'I don't like the scent.' Or, 'I've bought your product before. It smells so lovely. I don't like this.' Then we realized it was the wax we were using.”

Kaeck was able to return some of that particular wax to the supplier.

“But that took some pivoting on the customer service end,” she said. “And making sure our customers were happy by sending them product that didn't have a strong scent.”

The Fabric

Sourcing the cotton fabric received the same kind of care as sourcing the wax. It's woven specifically for the company.

“Another piece of this puzzle was to figure out the perfect fabric for our product,” Kaeck said. “We started off with muslin, which worked great in the beginning. But then we developed something that worked even better for us. We found someone in the US who sourced organic, GOTS (global organic textile standard) certified fabric from Indonesia.”

The GOTS certification covers everything from the way the cotton is being grown to the workplace environment and wages, safety at the mills and the dye houses — all the way from the fabric coming to the US.

“It's the highest standard for organic cotton in the world,” Kaeck said. “So that was really important to me. It was great to find it.”

Bee's Wrap brings over several container loads of fabric a year.

To develop the designs for the fabric, Kaeck worked with an artist friend.

“She's a fabric designer,” Kaeck said. “We pulled our first print from the logo, which was hand drawn by me. Then she developed this beautiful, beautiful honeycomb print. All of our prints have some sort of nature represented, and some sort of ecosystem, so the clover and the oceans and the bees and bears have an ecosystem. In Vermont, we use the maple buds, the honeycomb, the black raspberries. We work very closely on the prints.”

Usually, Kaeck comes up with the ideas.

“Then the artist goes back and puts a print together,” Kaeck said. “Then we have brainstorming sessions together. We usually have a couple of those before the piece is finalized, and then we choose the colors. We work very well, very collaboratively and it is an amazing process. It's really one of the most fun parts of my job.”

The Machine

The first Bee's Wraps were made with melted wax on a skillet in the Kaeck family kitchen. But scaling up the business meant finding a way to mechanize production.

“Doing it by hand was not sustainable for growth,” Kaeck said. “We pulled together resources. We had a local engineer. My father helped. The person who is my production manager now, helped. So did my assistant production manager. We all pooled ideas and worked on developing this piece of machinery that could wax whole rolls of fabric.”

Engineering experts studied how fabric rollers work. Experts in wax melting were called in.

“Then we had to bring those ideas together,” Kaeck said. “Our first machine worked great to start, and then we had to tweak things to get it to work right. There have been a lot of iterations along the way. And we had to build a custom tank for melting the wax. The first time we put the machine all together, we really had our fingers crossed that it was going to work. And it did!”

There exist machines that apply paraffin to cloth, but not this type of cloth, with this type of printing design.

“There's nothing exactly like this,” Kaeck said. “This we really had to come up with on our own because of these wax designs.”

The end result is a machine with rollers that pull the printed cotton through a well of melted wax. Kaeck actually has two of the machines now, but has not yet sought a patent.

Growing

When the company outgrew Kaeck's basement, it moved to Bristol.

“We moved there four years ago,” Kaeck said. “To a cool old building that has a great history. Vermont Coffee started there. It was a great incubator space for us.”

Growth came quickly after BuzzFeed (no pun intended) entered the picture.

“That gave us a big boost,” Kaeck said. “Two years ago BuzzFeed reached out to us and wanted to do something. They put together this cute little video and launched it. Within a couple days it had over 60 million views, and now it's at 80 million or 90 million. We were completely sold out of everything. So we had to ramp up.”

New employees were hired. Systems were changed so that the large influx of new orders could be handled efficiently.

“We had to bring in new wax melters,” Kaeck said. “We had shipping stations all over the place, trying to get product out. It was quite an experience. We pulled it off, which was a great feat for everyone who jumped on board. Everyone in the company and people in our community came to help. And so we've been building steadily off of that.”

Last September, Kaeck moved production to Middlebury; the offices followed in January of 2019.

Kaeck has competition. Bee's Wrap is not the only company making and selling beeswax-infused cloths for food storage.

“It's becoming very, very popular,” Kaeck said. “We're trying to stay very true to our brand and to our product.”

Growing as fast as this presents its own set of problems.

“At the same time we put the machine together we had new fabric and new print and new packaging,” Kaeck said. “We had to bring it all together in the fall, before our busy season. We get very busy in October, November and December because people like to give Bee's Wraps as holiday gifts. And it was a circus here. We got everything in-house. We have the photographs done. We launched the new look. We launched the new product. Things were working, and it sold and we ran completely out of packaging. And you can't turnaround packaging as quickly as we would have liked, because we were sourcing it from Georgia. It was far away. It was really challenging.”

The company went back to its original method of packaging to keep up with orders.

“We just pivoted,” Kaeck said. “We didn't go back to the old way of making the product, because our machine was working and we were able to keep it moving. But we were hand rolling and trying to keep customers happy. That was a customer service thing, and we had to keep on our toes.”

The Future

Kaeck is committed to growing the business and taking it in new directions. Up next, for example, is a vegan line of Bee's Wraps using a plant-based wax instead of beeswax.

“There are a number of different plants that give wax,” Kaeck said. “One example is palm wax. That's most likely not what we'll be using, but our recipe is not developed yet.”

Another avenue for growth is developing products that support the wraps.

“We're coming out with a drying rack for these wraps and we're pretty excited about that,” Kaeck said. “It's a rack used for drying, because Bee's Wrap is washed by hand in cool water so you don't melt the wax. And then you hang it to dry. People who use the wraps as a complete replacement for plastic wrap in their kitchens often have three or four wraps that need to dry at one time. This will make that easy to do.”

Kaeck is learning as she goes.

“With a quickly growing company, we've had to scale quickly over from the beginning, Kaeck said. “We started so small and so hands-on. It's about figuring out how to grow the company in the way that I like to work. But a company needs to have structure. So I envisioned — and I still envision — creating a very open and engaged workplace where different departments work together. But I'm also putting in structure where needed, to keep things fair for all employees. To be able to put into place things like health care and workplace safety — those require a structure, so we're making sure that we have these things in place, and at the same time being able to keep a very open, engaged, fun, great place to work.”

One way Kaeck is doing this is by working with Let's Grow Kids, a Vermont nonprofit working to ensure that every family has access to high quality childcare. The organization is helping Kaeck figure out the best way to provide her employees with childcare.

“Childcare is a fundamental support,” said Emily Blistein, the business strategy director of Let's Grow Kids. “I'm working with employers to make them champions of childcare. We want to help them look at their benefits and practices and how they can use benefits around childcare to help find and retain a productive workforce.”

Perhaps because Kaeck studied women's studies in college, or because she started her company by employing her social network, women dominate the Bee's Wrap work force. That makes a commitment to childcare a singularly important benefit.

“One of the things that interested me, going to school, was the balance of family and work life,” Kaeck said. “It's very much a challenge for women and it's a challenge for women here at Bees Wrap too. So we feel strongly here about creating a family-friendly workplace. We've put into place flexible work hours to make sure that women who need to be home after school can be there. One thing we're working for is childcare subsidies for employees. Our next step in that process is putting together a committee of employees to figure out, pin down exactly what those family-friendly benefits will be. The next step will be implementation.”

Blistein first met Kaeck when she was starting Bee's Wrap.

“I think Sarah is phenomenal,” Blistein said. “She started her business as a mom of three, and she has a commitment to the women in the community. She's worked hard so she can give them a good employment. She's incredibly committed to creating a sustainable product. She's been an incredible steward of community programs. She's committed to keeping her business in Vermont and growing it here. I think she's done a remarkable job.”

At the new facility, production happens in a large, light-filled room with friendly people working at their stations, but also chatting, joking, sharing food and giving each other back rubs. People bring their pets. Snacks are always available in the lunchroom. The day I visited was Taco Day. There's also a Salad Day every Wednesday.

“The Middlebury co-op makes salads in our reusable lunch containers,” Kaeck said. “So we take our lunch containers over on Tuesday. They make salads for us and bring them back.”

Kaeck said she feels her business, which is exploding, is just the tip of the iceberg.

“In terms of awareness of this type of product and our consumers, we feel like we have a ways to go — still,” Kaeck said. “Between the growth of the company and the awareness of the product, we've come a long way. But there is a lot more that can be done. So we're excited about that.”

52,"Milenio, a Mexican news outlet, is reporting this week that Tesla has concluded an agreement with the state of Nueve Léon to build a new factory west of the city of Santa Catarina. CleanTechinca readers may recall that Nueve Léon is home to so many suppliers for the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin that there is now a dedicated lane at the border crossing into the United States for all the trucks head north. Mileno says the agreement is confidential, but its sources say the agreement will be made public after the first of the year.

“Tesla will come to Santa Catarina. The investment will be finalized in the coming weeks, after the end of the year it will be announced. The commitment is that it must be completed immediately after the start of 2023. We know that it will generate employment and it will be located in the only area available, which is the west of that municipality. It is not possible to inform more, because there is a confidentiality contract,” according to Milenio‘s sources. Elon Musk made a visit to San Pedro Garza García and Monterrey in October.

The sources claim the land where the plant will be built has already been acquired, although a search of public land records failed to reveal any such completed transactions in the area west of Santa Catarina. “I understand that they already bought the land. Maybe they don’t want what happened with KIA to happen to them, but it is real that Musk made them confidential since the land around where it was bought is going to go up (in price),” said one of the sources. “I don’t think it is still (the property) in the name of the company.” The records search did reveal sales to companies such as Tesla Turbo, Tesla Engineering, Tesla Consultores, Tesla Electromechanics, Tesla Plastics, and Tesla Smart Sport, however.

During his visit on October 22, Elon Musk met with the governor of Nuevo León and other local dignitaries. On December 8, the governor assured that, despite the fact that any contracts were confidential, “historic” investments were about to arrive and that they would be among the largest in the country’s history.

“This six year term is coming an alignment of planets for Nuevo León. Due to different global circumstances, they make me sign confidentiality contracts, so I can’t talk about more, but I can tell you halfway that historic investments are coming for Nuevo León , some of them, to give you an idea, they will be the largest investments in the history of the country,” the governor said.

On November 30, Aeroméxico announced the reactivation of its trips traveling from Monterrey to Querétaro, León, Guanajuato, and Los Angeles, California, beginning on December 15. The cross-border flights will connect the Nueve Léon with the West Coast of the United States and will contribute to strengthening the relations of the entity’s automotive businesses on the eve of Tesla’s arrival in the Mexican state.

The Takeaway

With so few details available, there are many unanswered questions about what Tesla is up to in Mexico. Does it make sense for Tesla to build another factory when the Gigafactory in Austin is just up the road, geographically speaking? Tesla’s other factories are separated by continents. Is this a signal that Tesla is considering selling its cars in Central and South America? Or is this factory going to make components for the Austin facility?

All will be revealed in the fullness of time. When we know more, you will know more."
53,"Elon Musk's plans to build a Tesla Gigafactory in Brandenburg, Germany are concerning conservationists, who want to protect the forest in which the factory will be built in.

According to the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU), the Western Barbastelle species of bat is particularly vulnerable and would need to be relocated.



Tesla has already announced that it wants to reforest an area three times the size of its building site to make up for the loss during construction. But conservationists say prioritizing quantity over quality is not enough.

Despite all this, they have decided not to protest the construction of the factory because it is opening up job opportunities for a state that has been struggling with unemployment since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Elon Musk's recent announcement that he wants to build a Tesla Gigafactory near Berlin has been causing a stir.

Environmentalists, in particular, are worried about the tech giant's plans to clear a large part of a protected forest in Grünheide, Brandenburg. In a German state that is largely made up of natural landscapes and relies heavily on nature tourism, the planned arrival of a giant new Tesla factory is causing controversy.

Crucial to the construction of the Gigafactory is whether or not endangered or vulnerable species are currently inhabiting the planned building site.

Friedhelm Schmitz-Jersch, the chairman of the Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Brandenburg, wants clarity on the issue as soon as possible.

""We need to start mapping out which species need to be taken into account,"" he said in an interview with Business Insider.

To do this, specialists would need to be commissioned to systematically search the area for endangered species and then provide an opinion.

A vulnerable species of bat must be relocated

Schmitz-Jersch visited the site last Friday to take a closer look at the area where the Gigafactory will be built. While it consists largely of pine trees, ""it is not a forest with rich biodiversity,"" the conservationist said.

A development plan for the area, which lies in a protected nature reserve, was already devised back in 2001, but Schmitz-Jersch thinks it is most likely out of date. ""It [the plan] is now almost 20 years old. We also have to ask ourselves: How careful were they at identifying the species at the time?""

Among the vulnerable animals in the forests are the Eurasian hobby bird and a species of bat which spends the winter living in old pine tree hollows, the Western Barbastelle.

Before clearing begins, the animals would need to be resettled. In good news, that could be a smooth process. ""If the new quarters are well-suited, the risks of relocation can be virtually eliminated or severely limited,"" said Schmitz-Jersch.

Scientists are rejecting Tesla's reforestation plan

Tesla has already announced that it wants to reforest an area three times the size of its building site, to make up for the loss during construction.

But conservationists aren't very impressed: ""We consider the one-to-three compensation to be problematic.""

According to Schmitz-Jersch, the law in Brandenburg states that there must be either a qualitative or a quantitative compensation for land that is eliminated. But NABU would much prefer quality over quantity.

""The surface area must come from somewhere,"" he said. For example, the replacement area could eliminate important agricultural land. Neglected grassland, which is often perceived as unattractive, could also be valuable for nature conservation. ""We would rather want to ask: What can be done to upgrade the existing forest? There are many ways to do this, such as creating additional water bodies or clearings, or converting the forest in such a way that it becomes more diverse.""

A large-scale project like the Tesla factory will not only have direct consequences for the forest, but it will also affect nature and its animals in the surrounding areas. ""Unfortunately, this cannot be completely avoided,"" says Schmitz-Jersch. ""Therefore, we ask that insect conservation is given thought to when Tesla considers the lighting for the factory. Many nocturnal insects are attracted by light.""

The same applies to noise, soil, and water protection. ""However, there are still no verifiable documents that we can assess,"" the conservationist said. ""We are still at the very beginning of the project, and can therefore not yet have a concrete opinion.""

What do scientists want from Tesla?

However, NABU says it has already been in touch with Tesla, as well as state authorities and the local government. Schmitz-Jersch is hoping for ""good and efficient talks."" ""We are confident that the state authorities and Tesla will be approachable when it comes to nature conservation,"" he said. ""This is how I understand the announcements made so far.""

According to the plans, construction work on Tesla's Gigafactory is expected to begin in the first half of 2020. ""In order to cope with the time pressure, we need a great deal of transparency,"" Schmitz-Jersch said. He would like politicians to come up with a concept for the region, including the far-reaching consequences that the Tesla factory will have on other things such as traffic and housing. ""Conservation areas should be avoided in this process,"" he said.

NABU finds itself in a difficult situation with Tesla's arrival. As nature conservationists, they want to protect the environment, but the electric car manufacturer is also creating many new jobs in a region that has struggled with high unemployment rates since the fall of the Soviet Union.

The conservationists have therefore chosen not to protest against the construction of the factory. ""That is not our intention. We are aware that the hopes and expectations of many thousands of people are connected with the factory,"" says Schmitz-Jersch. ""We think that good cooperation is possible."""

When Tesla started constructing Gigafactory Berlin, the company stated that every tree cut down for the upcoming electric car factory would be replaced threefold. Tesla, together with the Naturraum für Generationen (NfG), started planting the first batch of seedlings to replace the trees that would be cut in Giga Berlin in October 2020. And the project has not let up since.

A recent report from German news outlet rbb24 revealed that Tesla’s reforestation project has now covered over 175 hectares of land. That’s over the roughly 156 hectares that have been cleared to date, and more than half of the Giga Berlin complex’s overall area, which stands at about 300 hectares.

Wie steht es eigentlich um die @Tesla

Aufforstung? Unser Geschäftsführer Axel Behmann und Martin Szaramowicz von der Flächenagentur lassen keine Frage unbeantwortet. Heute von 19:00-19:30 im RBB! pic.twitter.com/YKbcBgN02B — Naturraum für Generationen (@nfg_brandenburg) May 7, 2021

The news outlet noted that the information regarding Tesla’s reforestation initiatives was gathered from individuals familiar with the project. That being said, with about 62% of the project now completed, expectations are high that the remaining 38% of the trees would be planted this year.

The update seemed to have been confirmed by the Naturraum für Generationen, as the agency opted to retweet a post outlining rbb24’s findings on Tesla’s reforestation efforts on its official Twitter account. Interestingly enough, with more than 175 hectares worth of trees already being planted, Tesla has effectively met German environmental regulations, which require a tree to be planted for every tree that is cut down.

#treelon

According to German environmental law, Tesla must plant a new tree for every one that is cut down.

The cleared area is equivalent to 294ha, of which 62% has already been replanted and the remaining 38% will be planted this year. carried out by:@nfg_brandenburg pic.twitter.com/WkDhXDG27D — @GF4Tesla 🇪🇺 🇩🇪 🏗️🏗️.build #GigaBerlin. (@Gf4Tesla) May 9, 2021

The progress of Giga Berlin’s reforestation initiatives has been received positively so far. Martin Szaramowitz from the Brandenburg Land Agency noted that “everything is growing quite well here” while examining a field near Beeskow. Naturraum für Generationen Executive Director Axel Behmann, for his part, lauded the project for creating a mixed forest with trees that are of the highest ecological quality.

“Here, we have the opportunity to imitate nature and to design the forest in such a way that it is as good for the climate as possible. This is real pioneering work that we are doing here. Reforestation in this diversity – has never happened before,” Behmann noted.

Of course, there is no assurance that all the trees planted by Tesla and the NfG would fully mature, especially as the adverse effectsof climate change become more prominent. Thus, in about eight to ten years, the forest authority would be checking if the reforestation had been successful. In the event that Tesla’s planted mixed forest is found lacking, Szaramowitz noted that some reworking would have to be done. Considering Tesla’s willingness to plant three times more trees than it had cut, however, even a potential rework would likely not be an issue.

55,"In an internal meeting, Tesla teased new and updated energy products coming later this year along with a better customer front-end for solar installations.

Tesla’s energy division definitely lives in the shadows of its automotive business. When most people think “Tesla,” they think of electric cars, but the company has had a renewed focus on energy products lately through its Tesla Energy division.

We noted that Tesla’s solar division had its best quarter in four years last quarter. Some of the improvements have been achieved through an improved product offering.

In an internal Tesla Energy-wide meeting obtained by Electrek today, Tesla explained that it improved its energy product offering by going from a mix of third-party equipment to Tesla equipment with its own software integration over the last two years.

During the meeting, Seth Winger, senior manager of solar products engineering at Tesla, said that new and updated Tesla Energy products are coming this year:

The engineer said that he can’t reveal specifics yet, but he commented:

In 2022, we are heavily investing in Tesla products. I can’t say exactly what is coming we want to maintain confidentiality but across the board on PVs, on Solar Roof, on Powerwall look forward to greatly improved installation efficiency, aesthetic, and product performance.

Winger also said that some people on the call know it already – and if they do, they should “keep it a secret” – but there are pilot programs coming soon.

Electrek recently reported that Tesla is testing a new version of Solar Roof (v3.5) on employees’ homes, but Winger now makes it sound like Tesla is also working on a new and updated Powerwall and solar panels.

During the call, Tesla also announced that it is about to deploy a new “Intereactive layout experience” for customers.

A Tesla manager said that customers are going to be able to interact directly with the layout and help Tesla with the project:

Customers are going to be able to engage with zero-touch layouts. They are going to be able to see a max kW design in their Tesla account.

They are going to be able to tell Tesla things like where to drop its equipment for the project.

The company is still working on the new interface, but based on early testing, Tesla expects that the new portal is going to reduce post-permit redesign requests by 20%, utility rejections by 30%, and “average handle time (chat)” by 10%.

Internally, Tesla is also updating its grid UI to more easily and quickly understand the status of a job flow.

The company is hoping that these new products and tools will help Tesla Energy achieves new highs during the second half of the year."

Apple is making the Sidecar white paper available on its website.

This is a PDF document you can download to your system to read. Apple also published an Accessibility white paper. Both white papers were made available within the macOS Catalina features page.

The iOS/iPad OS pages haven’t yet been updated with the white papers.

What does the white paper say?

In brief, the white paper tells you how Sidecar works and provides all the information you need to really make use of it. This includes:

Setup

Key features

Use as a second display

Use as a tablet input device

An explanation of the controls in the Menu

How to switch between Sidecar and iPad mode

How the technology works

What is the Sidebar for?

The paper also provides more insight into how Apple is thinking about the Sidebar, which lets iPad users access frequently used modifier keys, such as Command, Option or Shift when working on a Mac app on an iPad.





The inclusion of the Sidebar and the explanation for it provided in the white paper hints Apple is searching for some way to replicate use of modifiers on iOS.

Double tapping a modifier key keeps it active, Apple says. Tap it again to switch it back to neutral.

How does the technology work?

The white paper reveals that Sidecar uses the same tech as all Continuity features, including an encrypted encoded stream to send the virtual display to the iPad.

This sends display video from Mac to iPad, and tablet events from iPad to Mac. Sidecar uses Bluetooth for initial detection, and then point-to-point Wi-Fi for data transfer once connected.

Sidecar works with all apps as support for it is included at a System level. Developers can use tablet events in AppKit to turn on pressure and tilt for Apple Pencil. They can also choose custom behaviors in response to double-tap on the side of Apple Pencil using a changeMode event.

What hardware is supported?

Apple confurms that not every Mac or iPad supports Sidecar, which: “Requires Mac with Skylake processors and later models, and iPad models that support Apple Pencil.”

Sidecar-supported Macs:

MacBook introduced in 2016 or later

MacBook Air introduced in 2018 or later

MacBook Pro introduced in 2016 or later

Mac mini introduced in 2018 or later

iMac introduced in late 2015 or later

iMac Pro introduced in 2017 or later

Mac Pro introduced in 2019

Sidecar-supported iPads:

12.9-inch iPad Pro

11-inch iPad Pro

10.5-inch iPad Pro

9.7-inch iPad Pro

iPad (6th generation or later)

iPad mini (5th generation)

iPad Air (3rd generation)

The white paper is available here and should be read by anyone attempting to figure out how Sidecar works.

57,"We all have that friend who’s got her (or his) life together. She has a great job. He’s got a loving partner. She works out. He makes his own yogurt. And the cherry on top: she tutors disadvantaged 2nd-graders twice a week.

What’s her secret? Experts say it might in fact be that time your friend sets aside for volunteering.

“There’s quite a bit of work on the benefits of volunteering, probably because in some ways it’s sort of the perfect activity,” says Nancy Morrow-Howell, MSW, PhD, director of the Harvey A. Friedman Center for Aging and a professor of social policy at Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, who researches the health benefits of volunteering.

“It seems to produce health for the volunteer. And it’s contributing to the greater social good, because generally volunteers are working with organizations on some sort of social mission,” she says. “It’s a win-win.”

Studies have linked volunteering with better mental health, including more life satisfaction, having a stronger sense of purpose, having greater self-esteem, having a sense of increased personal control, having less social isolation, having slower cognitive decline, and showing fewer depressive symptoms.

And evidence suggests volunteering has benefits for physical health, too.

A 2013 study analyzed data from 1,654 individuals who participated in the 2006 and 2010 waves of the national Health and Retirement Study that asked questions about volunteering and measured participants’ blood pressure when the survey was conducted and four years later. Controlling for things like age, gender, ethnicity, education and other factors, the individuals who reported volunteering at least 200 hours in the 12 months leading up to the survey had a 40 percent lower risk of having high blood pressure four years later than those that had volunteered less.

(In these types of studies “volunteering” is usually defined as some sort of service or helping activity done in a discretionary way outside of the home organized by an agency, Morrow-Howell says.)

To date, we’re not aware of studies linking volunteering with yogurt-making ability. But the point is that volunteering may increase well-being overall because it usually increases activity across the board, from physical activity to social activity to cognitive activity, Morrow-Howell says.

And other evidence suggests that being engaged in all of those different areas promotes both physical and emotional health, she adds.

Different roles, of course, are more socially engaging than others. Others are more cognitively challenging or physically stimulating. You’ll get something out of each of those roles. But the theory would suggest that the more the work covers all of those bases (keeping you moving, socially engaged and mentally challenged), the more benefit you might (theoretically) get.

Unfortunately finding such an opportunity that checks all of those boxes and fits into your schedule may not be straightforward to find. But it’s certainly not impossible, Morrow-Howell and others say.

When it comes to volunteering, too much choice may be counterproductive

Google “volunteer opportunities” and you’ll likely come across several national and local opportunities or resources that help place volunteers.

Those resources can be great for connecting rising volunteers with projects that fit their schedule and need them, Morrow-Howell says. But for some the sheer volume of choice can be overwhelming.

(In New York City, for example, someone can search volunteer projects by day of the week, time of day, subway line, and type of work, using certain databases. It’s great for finding that project that’s exactly what you’re looking for — as long as you know exactly what you’re looking for to begin with.)

Behavioral economics theory pretty clearly shows that to help people make better choices more easily, don’t overwhelm people with choices, Morrow-Howell explains. “We do just the opposite in volunteering. We throw a ga-zillion options at people thinking that everybody needs a lot of choice.”

And while it’s good to give volunteers choices that make volunteering their time and energy convenient, it’s also important to recognize that that much choice can overwhelm people and make it harder to find something that truly resonates, Morrow-Howell says.

5 tips for finding volunteer work that doesn’t feel anything like work

The point is — especially if you find yourself wanting to volunteer your time but having trouble finding something that you can stick with — maybe changing your tactics could help. Here are a few tips from Morow-Howell and others:

1. Do it with a friend

That same decision-making theory that says we get overwhelmed by too many choices says that people are much more likely to do something if others around around them are participating, says Morrow-Howell. That means you’ll be much more motivated to actually leave the office early for that youth mentoring program if you’re headed out with a co-worker or meeting a friend there.

2. Start small, go slow and let it grow

Don’t jump into a thrice-a-week commitment right away, Morrow-Howell says. Volunteer a day at a time, going back because you want to. As you develop relationships with the people there, more opportunities to get more involved will likely show up more naturally (and you may find the time commitment doesn’t seem so overwhelming).

3. Find a cause you care about

If you care about the cause you’re giving back to, you’re much more likely to feel good about the time you’re donating and keep doing it, says Victoria King, Community Outreach Coordinator with Volunteers of America in the Southeast Louisiana region.

Finding something meaningful can be as easy as identifying skills and abilities that you can bring to the table, along with a group or organization that needs those things, King says. “Key is finding someone that needs what you have to offer,” she says.

And speaking of what you have to offer…

4. Do something you love

Are you a musician? Is there somewhere you can donate your time and skill (like a local senior center)? Do you love to cook? Is there a local soup kitchen that might need help? “The extent to which a role is very engaging, fulfilling and purposeful to a person is important,” Morrow-Howell says.

5. Check local websites and national ones

Here’s where those volunteer matching programs and huge databases (like Volunteers of America or VolutneerMatch) may be helpful. If you have an activity in mind, a resource that can connect you to an organization or group of people who might benefit from your skills may be extremely helpful.

But if you can, try a few different opportunities out to figure out which one is the best fit, Morrow-Howell says.

58,"When Elon Musk, embattled CEO of Tesla, needed help getting hundreds of Model 3 cars to customers in the Pacific Northwest, he turned to someone he’d never met: Matt Moreno.

Moreno, a 45-year-old Microsoft engineer and avowed Tesla fanboy, was one of around a dozen local Tesla owners who volunteered to help Tesla employees deliver cars to customers at the company’s Bellevue, Wash., delivery and service centre during the company’s frantic, end-of-quarter delivery push late last month.

Over the course of several intense days, Moreno and his fellow volunteers spent hours helping new buyers familiarize themselves with a car that, with its screen-based control system and regular firmware updates, can feel more like a smartphone, or a spaceship, than an automobile.

The unusual effort, duplicated at Tesla delivery centres in other parts of the county, was part of a last-minute effort by the beleaguered Musk to meet ambitious third-quarter delivery goals for the make-or-break Model 3, despite months of production delays, regulatory problems and egregious, often self-inflicted public-relations damage.

For Musk’s many critics, the Model 3’s problems are simply more evidence that Musk and his controversial, unconventional company are on the verge of failure.

But for a Tesla true believer like Moreno (he and his wife, Laura, both drive them), such difficulties are an unavoidable part of Musk’s plan to disrupt and utterly remake personal transportation. So when the chance arose to join the fight, Moreno said, it felt like answering the call of duty.

“We are just right on the cusp of a revolution right now,” declares Moreno, with audible passion, about the Musk’s ambition. “I have no problem sacrificing a weekend for that.”

For Tesla’s fans and critics alike, this is a watershed moment for the company. The long-awaited Model 3 is Tesla’s most affordable offering. The price, currently $49,000 and set to fall to $35,000, according to Musk, is intended to make high-end electric cars attractive to mainstream, middle-class buyers. That, in turn, would give Tesla the volume it needs to become a low-cost producer —and gain long-awaited financial stability.

Yet from the start, skeptics have questioned Musk’s ability to execute such a bold strategy. Doubters have been particularly scornful of what Musk himself has dubbed “delivery logistics hell” —that is, problems resulting from trying to move tens of thousands of cars to customers via a minimalist distribution system that often seems to be developed on the fly. Indeed, when Tesla began rolling out its end-of-quarter deliveries over the summer, staging thousands of cars in parking lots, garages and other open areas around the country, skeptics loudly claimed Musk’s unconventional distribution model was in trouble.

Musk has long contended that such criticism is intended mainly to drive down Tesla’s share price, to the benefit of so-called short-sellers.

Worse, in the midst of the end-of-quarter push, Musk was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for making ill-considered tweets about private backers and Tesla’s future financial strategy. He was forced to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors, though he remains its CEO —and in the wake of that fight the company’s shares fell 14 per cent this past week.

On Sept. 21, amid the delivery crunch, came a ray of hope: a tweet from industry journalist Ryan McCaffrey, an unabashed Tesla fanboy, offering to help Musk make his targets. McCaffrey’s idea: free labour.

“A lot of Tesla owners, including myself, would be DELIGHTED to volunteer, for free, to help with deliveries in times like this,” McCaffrey tweeted. “We can’t do their paperwork but we CAN do orientations. It’s fun to educate new owners & see their joy & enthusiasm!”

Musk himself gratefully replied: “Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centres during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!”

Within 24 hours many Tesla delivery centres began reaching out to the company’s fan base via a national network of local Tesla owners clubs.

Among them was the 200-member Tesla Owners Club of the Pacific Northwest, based in Bellevue. According to Jay Turney, club vice president, the club immediately began co-ordinating volunteer efforts, which got underway on the morning of Wednesday, Sept. 26 and ran through Sunday, Sept. 30.

At the Bellevue delivery and service centre, a routine was quickly established: Tesla employees would handle all the payment and paperwork, while volunteers would then get buyers sufficiently comfortable with their new cars to drive away.

“Some people had never been in an electric vehicle, much less a Tesla,” said Turney, 56, a retired engineering manager. “Those folks, we spent as much time as they needed to get comfortable driving off.”

Tesla’s volunteer army is a perfect example of Tesla’s willingness to flout long-established business practices. Where most automakers rely on massive dealer networks and multimillion-dollar ad campaigns, Tesla has depended heavily on word-of-mouth and media coverage to build its brand and drive consumer demand while conserving its strained financial resources.

It’s a risky approach, in part because it depends on a degree of customer loyalty unheard of in the auto business —something akin to the fandom that Apple enjoys, but for a much more expensive product.

Tesla’s bet on customer zeal has paid off thus far. It’s a tribute, some would say, to the strangely intense chemistry between the cars and the tech enthusiasts who have been attracted to them. Many are admitted “early adopters” —people, like Moreno, who are willing not only to endure the frustrations of early models, but also to evangelize about the cars to the unconverted. Or, at the very least, to come in on a fine autumn weekend and help convert them.

“No other car company could get their customers to come back in and volunteer their time,” said Moreno, proudly. “This would never have happened for Dodge or GM or Chrysler or VW.”

Turney estimated he put in around 45 hours across five days. Others went as many as 60 hours. Some actually took time off from their real jobs in order to come in and volunteer.

The effectiveness of Tesla’s volunteer army is hard to gauge precisely. Overall, analysts say, Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter. That was four times what it had delivered in the first two quarters and well ahead of Wall Street expectations, according to CNBC.

How much of that was driven by volunteers like Turney and Moreno is hard to know. Officials at the Tesla delivery centre declined to comment and an emailed request for comment from Tesla’s corporate headquarters went unanswered. Volunteers themselves were reluctant to estimate, at least publicly, how many cars they’d moved during the delivery event —for fear that any numbers would be used by skeptics as evidence of Tesla’s delivery problems.

But anecdotally, the volunteer-led effort appears to have been a success. By the end of the weekend, one volunteer said privately, the Bellevue delivery centre had delivered cars to nearly every customer on its current customer list.

Volunteers were even able to do some recruiting of their own. One Tesla customer who spent Saturday picking up his car was so impressed by the volunteers that he came in Sunday and helped with deliveries.

“That kind of shows you the level of enthusiasm that Tesla owners have,” said Lori Howe, president of the local Tesla owners club, and a Tesla fan since 2010. “We know this is the future and we want to be part it.”

59,"Whatever you do, keep your coffee cup out of the bathroom. Trish Hamilton / Today

Hygiene can be, well, ambiguous. While there's no debate on whether it's okay to pee in the pool—the fact is, it's just plain gross—many of us choose to neglect the unwritten rules of hygiene, and heighten other people's risk of contracting unwanted germs, diseases, and illnesses.

The flipside of that, however, is that many people are unknowingly engaging in risky activities, doing seemingly normal things that are actually far nastier than they think. We compiled a list of things we thought were surprisingly disgusting, and ran them past our experts to weigh in. But honestly, just...stop.



Blowing the candles out on a birthday cake

Now that someone has said it, you can already envision it happening. The overjoyed young boy on his tenth birthday, wishing for a new Xbox, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath in, ready to put out the candle fire with a mixture of youthful wind power and saliva. ""Kids are virtual petri dishes of everything,"" says Donna Duberg, an assistant professor of Clinical Laboratory Science from Saint Louis University.

According to a study done by Clemson University, significant increases in bacteria were found in the icing on birthday cakes after the candles were blown out. Given the fact that this tradition has been in existence for decades, it's tough to gauge the threat of these bacteria. That said, it's probably not a smart idea for a sick kid to be spitting all over cake for the entire party.

""Kids are typically more likely to have colds and flus,"" says Charles Gerba, Ph.D., a professor of Microbiology and Environmental Sciences at the University of Arizona.

If you're paranoid and can't get the image of saliva falling like rain all over icing, take Duberg's advice and give the birthday child a smaller cake or a collection of cupcakes to blow out instead—and then have all to themselves. It'll minimize the damage, and the cake still lives on.



Bringing your coffee into the bathroom

You've just left the break room with a fresh cup of joe when an unexpected urge causes you to take a detour to the bathroom. What's wrong with just popping that on the sink while you take care of business?

""Let's get real, you shouldn't be taking anything in there with you,"" says Duberg. The fecal matter that is crawling all over the bathroom will inevitably latch on to your cup and follow you back to the office. Be advised: the cross contamination doesn't stop at your desk.

""Office coffee cups are loaded with fecal matter,"" says Gerba. ""Because they're cleaned with sponges, it's easy for fecal bacteria to grow in large numbers."" Think twice before you bring your beverage into the can.



Sharing your headphones



Earwax is the most obvious grossness factor when sharing headphones and earbuds, but according to Duberg it should be the least of your concerns.

""You're worried about earwax, but that doesn't grow anything. It's the ear canal that grows stuff,"" she says.

She's more concerned with spreading bacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa, which give off an odor that resembles sweet grapes, or causing otitis media (ear infections), a common risk for children who contract streptococci as a result of frequent sharing of headphones and earbuds.

At the end of the day, that coat of visible earwax may seem like the grossest part, but the true danger lurks deeper. Keep your headphones to yourself.



Bellying up to the buffet

There are plenty of good things about buffets: unlimited food, tons of variety, and, well, that's it. Unfortunately—as much as you might be comforted by that sneeze shield—buffets can be major breeding grounds for food-borne illnesses.

""The risks are much more common than people think,"" says Gerba. He cites an example where a norovirus outbreak at a wedding was traced back to a metal serving spoon in the buffet line, contaminating all the guests.

There have been numerous incidents where buffets have cultivated diseases—E.coli, Salmonella, and Shigella are all potential risks when standing in line. Duberg recognizes the potential threat buffets can pose, and urges caution.

""Try to use disposable utensils—one spoon for one container—and uset hand sanitizer if you've got finger foods,"" Duberg says.



Bobbing for apples

Your vision of this classic Halloween party game is now forever warped with the thought of blinded contestants hopelessly shoving their open mouths into an opaque pool of murky apple water. All that saliva swirling about in that pot is a recipe for disaster.

""Strep throat is transferred through saliva,"" says Duberg. Any instance where your mouth is engaging with foreign saliva puts you at risk for contracting strep throat, like drinking out of the wine cup at church, Duberg explains.

Additionally, Gerba suspects the exposure of one's nose, eyes, and mouth is a gateway for infection. ""I wouldn't want to get anyone in there with a cold, flu or diarrhea ahead of me,"" says Gerba.

So what's the solution to avoiding contamination from this classic party game? ""There are alternatives where people are using chopsticks instead of their mouths to pull them out,"" says Duberg. Bob at your own risk, but it seems pretty wise to avoid shoving your head into a pool of everybody's spit.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The top U.S. military officer challenged the next generation of Army soldiers on Saturday to prepare America’s military to fight future wars that may look little like the wars of today.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, painted a grim picture of a world that is becoming more unstable, with great powers intent on changing the global order. He told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that they will bear the responsibility to make sure America is ready.

“The world you are being commissioned into has the potential for significant international conflict between great powers. And that potential is increasing, not decreasing,” Milley told the cadets. “Whatever overmatch we, the United States, enjoyed militarily for the last 70 years is closing quickly, and the United States will be, in fact, we already are challenged in every domain of warfare, space, cyber, maritime, air, and of course land.”

America, he said, is no longer the unchallenged global power. Instead, it is being tested in Europe by Russian aggression, in Asia by China’s dramatic economic and military growth as well as North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, and in the Middle East and Africa by instability from terrorists.

Drawing a parallel with what military officials are seeing in Russia’s war on Ukraine, Milley said future warfare will be highly complex, with elusive enemies and urban warfare that requires long-range precision weapons, and new advanced technologies.

The U.S. has already been rushing new, high-tech drones and other weapons to the Ukrainian military — in some cases equipment that was just in the early prototype phases. Weapons such as the shoulder-launched kamikaze Switchblade drones are being used against the Russians, even as they are still evolving.

And as the war in Ukraine has shifted — from Russia’s unsuccessful battle to take Kyiv to a gritty urban battle for towns in the eastern Donbas region — so has the need for different types of weapons. Early weeks focused on long-range precision weapons such as Stinger and Javelin missiles, but now the emphasis is on artillery, and increased shipments of howitzers.

And over the next 25 to 30 years, the fundamental character of war and its weapons will continue to change.

The U.S. military, Milley said, can’t cling to concepts and weapons of old, but must urgently modernize and develop the force and equipment that can deter or, if needed, win in a global conflict. And the graduating officers, he said, will have to change the way U.S. forces think, train and fight.

As the Army’s leaders of tomorrow, Milley said, the newly minted 2nd lieutenants will be fighting with robotic tanks, ships and airplanes, and relying on artificial intelligence, synthetic fuels, 3-D manufacturing and human engineering.

“It will be your generation that will carry the burden and shoulder the responsibility to maintain the peace, to contain and to prevent the outbreak of great power war,” he said.

In stark terms, Milley described what failing to prevent wars between great powers looks like.

“Consider for a moment that 26,000 — 26,000 — soldiers and Marines were killed in only six weeks from October to November of 1918 in the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne in World War I,” Milley said. “Consider also that 26,000 U.S. troops were killed in the eight weeks in the summer of 1944 from the beaches of Normandy to the liberation of Paris.”

Recalling the 58,000 Americans killed in just the summer of 1944 as World War II raged, he added, “That is the human cost of great-power war. The butcher’s bill.”

Thinking back to his own graduation, Milley paraphrased a popular Bob Dylan song from the time: “We can feel the light breeze in the air. And right now as we sit here on the plain at West Point, we can see the storm flags fluttering in the wind. We can hear in the distance the loud clap of thunder. The hard rain is about to fall.”"
61,"In a bid to promote its new Scuderia Ferrari SF16-H model, Lego has created a life-size version of Ferrari’s 2017 Formula One car.



Constructed with a phenomenal 349,911 bricks, the model weighs 567 kg (1,250 lbs), meaning it’s about 250 kg (551 lbs) lighter than the championship-leading race car.

Lego says the model took 750 hours to build and it’s not hard to see where all that time was spent. The accuracy of the model is staggering and from a distance, one could actually mistake it for the real thing.

The model even features all of the stickers used across the exterior of the race car as well as a complex steering wheel complete with dozens of switches, buttons and dials.

62,"Washington [US], December 17 (ANI): Elon Musk on Saturday lifted the suspension of the Twitter accounts of a slew of journalists that he had banned earlier following the results of a poll he conducted among Twitter users.

""The people have spoken. Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now,"" the Twitter owner tweeted.

The people have spoken.



Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now. https://t.co/MFdXbEQFCe — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 17, 2022



According to Fox News, a US-based news outlet, Musk polled users for 24 hours to choose whether the accounts should be restored ""immediately"" or ""in 7 days."" In a 59-41 point split, Twitter users largely chose ""now."" The survey received responses from about 3.7 million Twitter users.

In a different poll Musk conducted on Thursday, ""now"" also outperformed ""tomorrow,"" ""in 7 days,"" and ""longer,"" but Musk said the poll featured ""too many options.""

Famous legacy media journalists, including CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, New York Times technology reporter Ryan Mac, and Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell, were abruptly informed that they were ""permanently suspended"" during what has come to be known as the ""Thursday Night Massacre.""

Journalists Micah Lee of The Intercept, Steve Herman of Voice of America, Matt Binder of Mashable, Keith Olbermann of ex-MSNBC, and Aaron Rupar of ex-Vox were also impacted.

The controversy began when @ElonJet, an account that only tracked Musk's use of private aircraft, was suspended. Because the account was ""doxxing real-time location info"" and posting video of a ""crazy stalker"" who was harassing his child in Los Angeles while believing the Twitter owner was present, Musk claimed the account was suspended for a ""physical safety violation"" and was consequently suspended. Musk threatened to sue the person who used the account.

On Wednesday, Musk warned Twitter users, ""Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.""

The users who were banned from Twitter on Thursday either shared links to the private aircraft monitoring on their own Twitter accounts or had reported on @ElonJet's suspension.

According to Fox News, many criticised the premise of Musk's ""doxxing"" accusations because his use of a private jet is public knowledge, while others accused him of hypocrisy because the billionaire had referred to himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" during his acquisition of Twitter.

Statements from CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post all criticised the ""impulsive and unreasonable"" action and demanded that their correspondents be allowed back on Twitter.

Many backed Musk by claiming that the journalists had violated the rules. Others rejoiced in the suspensions, claiming that individuals who received punishment championed censorship and kept quiet when Twitter retaliated against others before Musk, such as the New York Post during the 2020 presidential election for its reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop scandal.
