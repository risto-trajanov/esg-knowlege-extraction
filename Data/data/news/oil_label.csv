As people gather for special meals around the holidays, consumer advocates are warning about the dangers of gas stoves.

During a news conference held by the Public Interest Research Group, advocates highlighted the risks burning gas indoors pose to health and the climate.

Dr. Steph Lee, a pediatrician with Penn State Health St. Joseph and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said air pollution can increase the risk of childhood asthma.

“Burning natural gas does create nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other byproducts that contribute to air pollution and are lung irritants,” Lee said.

Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said indoor air pollution can also cut short the lives of older adults.

“That’s why I think we need to be talking about regulating gas stoves, whether that’s drastically improving emissions or banning gas stoves entirely,” Trumka said.

Gas stoves can leak pollutants even when turned off, creating a health hazard and sending more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

Trumka said people may believe they are taking the right safety measures by using an exhaust fan when they cook, but many range hoods only redistribute pollutants inside the home, instead of moving the exhaust outside.

Trumka said good alternatives to gas stoves already exist.

Induction stovetops use magnetic energy to heat pots on the stove even faster than gas, but they are more expensive. The federal Inflation Reduction Act includes $4.5 billion for states to give rebates for electric appliances, including stoves.

Chris Galarza, a Pittsburgh-area chef and founder of the commercial kitchen electrification company Forward Dining Solutions, gave a cooking demonstration with an induction stovetop.

He started with an ice cold pan sitting on top of a dish towel on the cooktop. He added vegetables and shrimp and had them sauteed to completion in just a few minutes.

He said induction cooking has the benefit of a cooler and safer work environment for professional and home cooks. Induction stovetops send electromagnetic energy straight to the pan, so the surface of the cooktop does not warm up. Galarza said it’s a myth that you need a gas range to make good food.

“Cooking is about fundamentals and technique and not about your fuel source,” Galarza said.

Gas industry groups dispute findings that gas stoves impact indoor air quality and say efforts to move away from gas stoves limit consumer choice.

Deteriorating air quality is synonymous with Delhi winters. Though there are several reasons for poor air quality in the national capital region (NCR), industries — one of the primary air pollution contributors — are finding it difficult to switch to cleaner fuels due to price hikes.

Central pollution monitoring body Commission for Air Quality Management had earlier issued orders for industries to switch to clean fuel. Emissions due to the use of polluting fuels by industries and vehicles contribute significantly to the degradation of air quality in Delhi-NCR.

CAQM shared a list of approved fuels June 23, 2022. The list came into effect for areas with existing PNG infrastructure and supply October 1, 2022. For areas without piped natural gas (PNG) supply, the list will come into effect January 1, 2023.

The commission approved petrol and diesel for vehicular fuel; hydrogen and methane for industrial and vehicular fuel; and compressed natural gas (CNG), PNG, liquefied petroleum gas and liquefied natural gas for vehicular, industrial and domestic purposes.

Electricity was approved for industrial, commercial, domestic and vehicular fuel and biofuels and refuse-derived fuel for power, cement and waste-to-energy plants.

Firewood and biomass can be used for religious purposes, wood and bamboo charcoal for tandoors and grills of hotels, restaurants and banquet halls with emission channelisation and control systems. Wood and bamboo charcoal are permitted at open eateries and dhabas too.

Wood charcoal for cloth ironing and electricity, CNG, firewood and biomass briquettes can be used for crematoria. Biomass, agriculture refuse, pellets, briquettes, metallurgical coke and low-sulphur fuel, can be used for industrial purposes only beyond the jurisdiction of Delhi government.

However, the increasing rates of natural gas and biomass make implementing CAQM’s direction grim. In the table below, we can see the hike in biomass prices, which is around a 28 per cent increase over the last three years.

BIOMASS PRICE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS

Year Biomass Price/Kg 2020 Rs 3-5 2021 Rs 5-6 2022 Rs 5-7

COMPARING PRICES OF PNG IN DELHI-NCR

The above graph shows the steep increase in PNG prices in Haryana, which is almost doubled (42 per cent) in the last three years. In Uttar Pradesh, PNG prices are doubled (52 per cent) in the last three years. There are similar patterns of prices rising (46 per cent) in Delhi and in Rajasthan (39 per cent rise).

Non-profit Centre for Science and Environment conducted a study on “Assessment of Industrial air pollution in Delhi-NCR” in the year 2020.

The total consumption of coal by industries was around 1.4 million tonnes/year in seven districts (Alwar, Bhiwadi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Panipat and Sonipat) of NCR, the study highlighted. After this study, CAQM removed the use of coal from the approved fuel list for NCR.

Soaring fuel prices

The rising prices of biomass and PNG are hitting the industries badly and, in return, can affect their production capacity and the country's economic growth.

The government October 1, 2022 raised the prices of gas produced from old fields, which make up for about two-thirds of all gas produced in the country. It was hiked from $6.1 per million British thermal units to $8.57 per million British thermal units, according to oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).

One of the biggest solutions for clean air is the transition to cleaner fuels. The transition to gas has been the key action taken by Beijing to reduce its air pollution. Changing the fuel itself led to massive air pollution benefits.

In fact, all industries will benefit from the transition to clean fuel as they would reduce the cost of air pollution control devices (APCD) and governments would also reduce the costs of regulation.

There are also advantages to the economy from the use of natural gas — its use will be regulated and metred and therefore, industrial production will be better accounted for.

However, today looking at the increasing price of piped natural gas, it becomes difficult for industries to shift to natural gas and meet the CAQM deadline of January 1, 2023 for the areas where PNG is not available. Due to rising PNG prices, financially weak industries may be forced to shut down.

On one side, we are putting efforts into making a clean environment by introducing and mandating the use of cleaner fuels and banning polluting fuels. On the other hand, increasing prices of cleaner fuel restrict the goal.

Governments should consider subsidising rates of cleaner fuel. CSE has advocated for a long time to bring down the costs of clean fuel in the country and try to include it under the goods and services tax."
2,"These days, when powerful corporations get caught breaking the law, polluting the Earth, violating human rights, or all of those crimes simultaneously, they don’t pay the fine and make amends, like normal citizens. They attack.

Corporate lawyers spend millions to assault victims with SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation). The most recent SLAPP strategy in the US, popularized by attack-dog New York law firm Gibson Dunn, employs US “racketeering” (RICO) laws against environmental groups, victims of pollution, and their lawyers.

The purpose of a SLAPP lawsuit is not necessarily to win in court, but rather to intimidate, harass, demonize, and bankrupt the weaker opponent. “The powerful use their abundance of resources to enact revenge,” explains the American Civil Liberties Union. Many jurisdictions now ban SLAPP suits, but corporations still shop around for lax jurisdictions and sympathetic judges.

In 2013, for example, when Greenpeace Canada exposed Resolute Forest Products’ destructive logging in Québec, Resolute filed a retaliatory $7-million lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada and two staff members in Ontario, which did not yet have anti-SLAPP laws. Later, Resolute used US courts to attack Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, created in 1970 to prosecute organized crime syndicates. “This lawsuit,” said Greenpeace US director Annie Leonard, “is an attempt to silence, vilify, and criminalize activism.” As with most of these intimidation lawsuits, the RICO case in the US was thrown out of court, but Resolute promptly filed an amended suit.

In perhaps the most vindictive SLAPP in history, Chevron — one of the world’s largest corporations, with over $260-billion in assets — found a sympathetic New York judge to accept a RICO lawsuit against the victims of its vast oil pollution in Ecuador’s Amazon basin.

Legal thuggery

Chevron’s Amazon troubles began in 2000 when it purchased Texaco, inheriting liability for the company’s oil field pollution in Ecuador, known as the Amazon Chernobyl. Texaco/Chevron had dumped some 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers and abandoned over 900 carcinogenic waste pits. The Indigenous rainforest inhabitants claim they were left with destroyed land, polluted water, and an epidemic of cancer and birth defects.

In 1993, the victims sued for damages in the US. Chevron fought for nine years to shift the case to Ecuador, where they may have expected to influence the courts. Chevron fully accepted jurisdiction in Ecuador, where the case began in 2003. Six years later, in light of overwhelming scientific evidence, Chevron realized that they would likely lose. In 2009 the oil company hired the notorious “rescue squad” law firm of Gibson Dunn, found a corporate-friendly Judge, Lewis A. Kaplan in New York, and began a series of SLAPP attacks on the victims, on their lawyers, and on the Ecuadorian judicial system. Over the next five years, Kaplan allowed virtually any Chevron motion, denied defendant motions, mocked the victims and their lawyers, and allowed a RICO racketeering case against two Ecuadoreans — Secoya Indigenous leader Javier Piaguaje and farmer Hugo Camacho — and their American lawyer, Steven Donziger.

Meanwhile, in Ecuador, the Indigenous and peasant villagers won a $9.5 billion compensation judgment, confirmed by appellate courts and by Ecuador’s Supreme Court (Court of Cessation). In response, Chevron sold its assets in Ecuador, fled the country, refused to pay, and threatened the victims with a “lifetime of litigation.”

The company has since retained over 60 law firms, 2,000 lawyers, paralegals, six public relations firms, squads of private investigators, and at least one bribed witness, who later admitted to lying. Lawyers for the victims estimate Chevron has spent over $2 billion to avoid payment of the court judgement, the largest collection of SLAPP suits in history.

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (Gibson Dunn) promotes itself as a corporate “rescue squad” specializing in “shielding clients” from “billions in liability”. They boast of getting George W. Bush installed as US president by stopping a Florida vote recount, and shielding Lehman Brothers from liabilities in the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.

Randy Mastro co-chairs the firm’s litigation department; infamous for a string of court censures for fabricating evidence, lying and other criminal misconduct. In 2015, the High Court of England sanctioned Gibson Dunn for fabricating evidence to frame the political rival of the firm’s client, the President of Djibouti, Africa.

In 2005, a federal court in California sanctioned Gibson Dunn for tampering with a witness, “obstruction, gamesmanship and flagrant disregard” of Court orders. In 2007, the Montana Supreme Court assessed a $9.9 million fine against Gibson Dunn for “blatantly and maliciously trying to intimidate” its adversary, using the judicial system for “legal thuggery”. The following year, a New York federal judge sanctioned the firm for “unacceptable shenanigans”, including hiding documents and outright lies. A California federal judge concluded that the firm’s misconduct is “a product of a culture which permeates” Gibson Dunn.

As Chevron faced losing the pollution case in Ecuador, CEO John Watson and General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate turned to Gibson Dunn’s “rescue squad” for help. The lawyers, led by Mastro, soon revealed their abusive tactics. An Oregon federal judge sanctioned the Gibson Dunn lawyers for using the discovery process — intended to provide information to opposing counsel — to harass a small legal non-profit assisting the Ecuadorian victims. In Ecuador, appellate judges rebuked Chevron’s new lawyers for threatening trial Judge Nicolas Zambrano with criminal charges and prison unless he dismissed the case.

However, the Ecuadorian decision stood, Chevron owed its victims $9.5 billion, and Randy Mastro went to work harassing the victims, their lawyers, and the Ecuadorian justice system before a gleefully encouraging Judge Kaplan in New York.

Judge as prosecutor

Chevron and Gibson Dunn knew precisely who Judge Kaplan was, when they launched their series of SLAPP suits through his court.

In 2004, Kaplan allowed the NY Police Department to arrest any “recognizable group” of 50 or more cyclists riding together, as a way of stopping bicycle protests, specifically by the environmental group Critical Mass. Although the First Amendment of the US Constitution protects “freedom of assembly”, Kaplan argued that “traffic flow” held precedent over the right of citizens to assemble in peaceful protest. When Lehman Brothers employees sued Lehmans for failing to protect their pension plan, violating the Employee Retirement Security Act, Kaplan simply dismissed the case.

At The Robing Room, a judicial review forum, one commenter warned, “if you are representing big business interests, Judge Kaplan will find a way to rule in your favor. If you going up against big business interests, you are out of luck.” Others describe Kaplan as “working for business interests” and “part of the old-boy network.”

“We knew that Gibson Dunn and Chevron had selected Judge Kaplan as an ally,” said Steven Donziger, lawyer for the original Ecuadorian plaintiffs, Frente de Defensa de la Amazonía (FDA). “A normal judge’s responsibility is to insure impartiality, decorum, and legal integrity. In the RICO SLAPP suit, Kaplan served more as a member of the prosecution team. He mocked defendants, laughed at defense motions, praised Chevron, granted their every wish, and insulted the entire Ecuadorian justice system.”

Marathon of preliminaries

The highly unusual three year discovery and deposition process, prior to the actual trial, revealed a succession of nightmarish legal irregularities:

No media confidentiality: The SLAPP began in April 2010, when Kaplan forced filmmaker, Joseph Berlinger to turn over 600 hours of outtakes from his acclaimed 2009 documentary, Crude: The Real Price of Oil. Kaplan ridiculed the journalist’s request to protect confidential sources. “If this is your best argument,” jeered Kaplan, “you’re in a lot of trouble.” A media coalition — including The New York Times, NBC, and HBO — filed a First Amendment objection with the court, and Robert Redford, writing in the Huffington Post, called the decision a “shocking” betrayal of US First Amendment rights.

Insulting a foreign Court: Kaplan and Chevron lawyer Mastro used the Berlinger hearings to insult the courts in Ecuador, where Chevron had insisted the trial be held. Mastro called the Ecuador courts “a sham” that would cause “any American to shudder at … what passes for a judicial system.” Kaplan openly laughed when asked to delay until an Ecuadorian court could provide input. “If this were the High Court in London,” Kaplan taunted, “you can be sure I’d wait.” Despite Mastro and Kaplan’s disdain here, the Ecuadorian justice system appears as impartial and honourable as any such system in any modern nation.

Insulting the defendants: Throughout the proceedings and in written memoranda, Kaplan referred to the 30,000 class-action victims in Ecuador as “so-called plaintiffs”, suggesting that their “standing in this matter is debatable to say the least.” He referred to their case in Ecuador as “the game” and “not a bona fide litigation.” When Donziger’s attorney made a routine request for time to review thousands of documents, Kaplan scoffed, “Don’t tell me about how long Mr. Donziger needs. I know the game here.”

No attorney-client confidentiality: Kaplan invoked a minor technicality to claim that Donziger, the victims’ US lawyer, had “waived” all attorney-client privilege, and insisted he turn over to Chevron lawyers 17-years of confidential communications with his clients, including, emails, notes, and his entire hard drive. Defense attorneys called this “the most sweeping forced production of privileged documents in history.”

Monster deposition: Federal rules typically limit individual depositions to one day, possibly two days in extraordinary cases. Once Chevron had all of Donziger’s confidential client files, they forced him, with Kaplan’s approval, to endure an unorthodox 18 days of discovery deposition, during which 20 or more Chevron/Gibson Dunn lawyers pelted him with petty and personal questions. According to Donziger’s RICO case rebuttal, Chevron’s lead PR consultant, revealed in 2009: “Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger.”

Special Master: Judge Kaplan appointed his former law partner, Max Gitter, as “Special Master” or private judge to rule over the protracted deposition, paid entirely by Chevron. According to the Amazon Defense Coalition, Kaplan approved secret payments to Gitter, totaling “likely well over $1 million.” Like Kaplan, Gitter approved Chevron requests and dismissed defense requests. He revealed his conspiratorial relationship with Mastro and Chevron when he made a ruling based on the contents of a future Chevron document that had not yet been filed with the court. Upon realizing his error, he muttered, “Mr. Mastro, am I correct about that?” Mastro responded, “absolutely correct.”

Judge proposes Chevron strategy: During the discovery hearings, Judge Kaplan exclaimed: “Do the phrases Hobbs Act, extortion, RICO, have any bearing here?” signaling to Chevron lawyers that they should file a racketeering complaint. Shortly thereafter, on February 1, 2011, Chevron filed their RICO complaint against Donziger, Piaguaje, and Camacho, claiming that the 10-year case before three levels of Ecuadorian courts amounted to criminal extortion. Chevron asked for billions of dollars in damages, from Donziger, a sole practitioner, and two impoverished villagers, which required a jury trial. Kaplan accepted the claim and assigned the case to himself.

International powers: After the RICO filing, Judge Kaplan presumed to issue a universal injunction, allegedly prohibiting any court in any nation from enforcing the environmental judgment against Chevron, two days before the Ecuadorian court announced that judgment. In September, 2011, the US Court of Appeals vacated the injunction, chastizing Kaplan for inflicting damage on international comity, the principle among modern nations to show respect for each other’s legal systems.

Implacable hostility: By this time, Donziger and the Ecuadorian victims were almost broke, which Donziger claims, “was the whole point of Mastro’s and Chevron’s strategy.” Nevertheless, renowned defense attorney, John Keker, a former US marine, highly respected for legal integrity, offered to help the beleaguered defendants. “This case has degenerated into a Dickensian farce,” Keker said. “Encouraged by this Court’s implacable hostility toward Donziger, Chevron will file any motion, however meritless, in the hope that the Court will use it to hurt Donziger.”

Fishing expeditions: Chevron served Donziger, Piaguaje, and Camacho, with hundreds of new document requests and over a thousand “requests for admission,” disputed claims that Chevron could argue were “admitted” if the defendants could not respond. The impoverished Ecuadorian peasants kept almost no documents and rarely engaged in written communication. The requests imposed a massive new expense for the defendants. Kaplan also allowed Chevron to serve subpoenas on Amazon Watch, Google, Microsoft, and others, seeking email accounts to track the activities of some 100 lawyers, students, journalists, and academics that supported the Ecuadorian’s cause. “These were fishing expeditions,” Donziger explained, “that violated everyone’s right to privacy.”

Scorched Earth: By May 2013, before the actual trial had even begun, the defendants were thoroughly destitute, and their defense attorneys — Keker and Craig Smyser, who had been deferring payment — could no longer continue. Both attorneys expressed outrage at Kaplan’s refusal to grant common sense measures to streamline the burdensome process. “Through scorched-earth litigation, executed by its army of hundreds of lawyers,” said Keker, “Chevron is using its limitless resources to crush defendants and win this case through might rather than merit.” Smyser, called the lawsuit a “legal blitzkrieg” that Kaplan not only tolerated but “encouraged”.

After four years of gruelling discovery depositions and document demands by Chevron — the exhausted defendants’ best hope for justice rested on the trial jury. A jury would remove some decision-making power from Kaplan, and would hear overwhelming evidence of Chevron pollution and legal misdeeds. However, Kaplan had new surprises in store.

The RICO Trial

No jury: On the eve of the trial, Chevron decided, with Kaplan’s approval, to drop their financial damages claim, which meant that Kaplan could drop the jury and decide the outcome himself. “Chevron,” said Donziger, “apparently panicked at the notion of trying to sell their fraud and extortion claims to anyone other than Kaplan.” The defense demanded a jury trial, based on their right to a jury in a RICO case, a long-standing legal principle in cases that carry criminal implications. Kaplan refused. He would decide himself about the defendants’ guilt or innocence.

No pollution talk: Even though Kaplan had presumed the authority to “set aside” an Ecuadorian environmental judgment with a 10-year, 220,000-page evidentiary record of Chevron’s environmental crimes, and to characterize that entire proceeding as an act of “extortion,” the corporate-friendly judge barred the defense from even mentioning anything “related to the existence of pollution in Ecuador.” The pollution, he said, was “not relevant.”

No dirty-tricks talk: Furthermore, Kaplan ruled that the defense could not mention evidence of Chevron’s campaign or Gibson Dunn’s campaign of “dirty tricks” operations, past courtroom crimes, lies, and fabricated evidence. Chevron, of course, was allowed to discuss any alleged history of the defendants, dredged up from four years of ruthless depositions, spies, and private investigators.

Tsunami of paper: On the first day of trial, Chevron placed over 2,500 exhibits into evidence en masse, nearly 10,000 separate assertions, to which the impoverished defense was given less than a week to respond. If they failed, Kaplan could deem the defendants’ objection “waived.”

Anonymous witnesses: Kaplan accepted testimony from Chevron witnesses whose identity they kept hidden from the defense, preventing the normal investigation necessary for effective cross-examination. The defense expressed outrage at this violation of “basic legal principles,” which they said would “be right at home in the Spanish Inquisition.”

Editing the evidence: At this point, the defense caught Randy Mastro presenting edited video, in which he had cut out critical contextual words from Mr. Donziger’s comments. According to trial transcripts, when the defense brought this to the judge’s attention, Kaplan adjourned, did some research, and responded: “About 15 words were edited out … I assume there was no attempt to mislead.”

Chevron’s claim that the entire Ecuadorian judicial process — ten years of court trials and appellate reviews in three levels of courts — had been “fraudulent” rested, however, almost entirely upon one, single witness.

The Witness

In American Lawyer magazine, in 2009, David Hechler, describes Gibson Dunn’s “game plan,” to shield clients from liability in foreign pollution cases: “find witnesses” who will accuse the foreign court of “fraud.” In a separate American Lawyer story, Gibson, Dunn lawyer Robert Cooper, explains, “We prepared the witnesses to tell our story.”

In Ecuador, on behalf of Chevron, Gibson Dunn found one such witness, Alberto Guerra, a former Ecuadorian judge who had been removed for misconduct, including accepting bribes. According to Amazon Watch, Chevron lawyer Andres Rivero and Chevron private investigator Yohi Ackerman paid Guerra $48,000 in cash, and agreed to pay him $12,000 a month for at least three years. Chevron lawyers allegedly negotiated and smoothed Guerra’s immigration into the US, paid for his family to move, hired lawyers to get them green cards, and bought them a car, auto insurance, and health insurance.

According to a letter from the defense to the US Department of Justice, Chevron has paid Guerra at least $2 million in cash and benefits, in exchange for false testimony. According to an affidavit by legal ethicist Erwin Chemerinsky — Founding Dean of the University of California at Irvine School of Law and a prominent US legal scholar — these payments to Guerra violated fundamental ethical rules of law.

In New York, over 53 days by Guerra’s admission, Gibson Dunn’s Randy Mastro helped him prepare his testimony about “fraud” in Ecuador. On the stand before judge Kaplan, Guerra claimed that Ecuadorian lawyers promised presiding judge Nicolas Zambrano $500,000 to allow them to write the final judgment, which Guerra claimed they gave to Zambrano on a flash drive. Guerra also claimed that he possessed a draft copy of the fraudulent judgment and that he met with the plaintiffs’ American lawyer Steven Donziger to discuss the alleged “bribe”.

Quickly, however, Guerra’s story fell apart. Immigration records showed that Donziger was not even in Ecuador when Guerra claims the meeting took place. No evidence of a flash drive was ever produced, and Guerra’s computers did not turn up the draft judgment, or even a single email from the plaintiffs’ attorneys. When this came to light, Guerra changed his story, claiming that after “strengthening my memory” he now recalled working on this draft, not at home, but rather had taken an eight-hour bus ride into the jungle, where he claimed he edited the judgment on a laptop handed to him by one of the Ecuadorians’ lawyers.

However, this story crumbled as well when forensic analysis showed that the trial judge had never downloaded the judgement from a flash drive and, rather, had opened and saved his own written judgement document more than 400 times over three months on his own office computer.

Furthermore, after the RICO trial, in a separate arbitration under the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, Guerra admitted under oath that he had lied to Chevron’s lawyers about his involvement in the alleged attempt to influence the Ecuadorian judgement. “I did exaggerate about [some things], yes,” said Guerra under questioning. When a lawyer asked him, “And among the ways you tried to leverage your position was to falsely tell the Chevron representatives that the Plaintiffs had offered you $300,000?” Guerra answered, “Yes, sir. I lied there.”

Nevertheless, Kaplan accepted Guerra’s testimony and rejected defense efforts — Motion to strike testimony and Motion for terminating sanctions — to strike Guerra’s testimony, which the defense claims was fabricated during the 53-day session with Chevron lawyers.

The final twist appeared as Judge Kaplan crafted a judgment. By dropping the money claim, Chevron had avoided a jury but also undermined its own case. A plaintiff must seek either money for damages or an injunction, a court-ordered condition placed on the defendant. The Court of Appeals had already reversed Kaplan’s earlier injunction and could do so again. Without a money claim or injunction, Chevron lacked standing.

Perhaps to avoid this problem, Kaplan based his guilty verdict on a “non-statutory claim for equitable relief” from an allegedly fraudulent judgment. According to Donziger’s rebuttal, the decision lacked “due process,” since the claim had never been presented by Chevron or argued in court, and “relied on vague 18th and 19th century treatises” that “had been effectively repealed and replaced by the statutory framework for enforcement of foreign judgments … during the twentieth century.” Typically, a judge can’t invent a new claim for the plaintiff after a trial has ended.

The Republic of Ecuador filed an Amicus Brief, stating that “Judge Lewis Kaplan reached far beyond the issues presented to unfairly—and unnecessarily—impugn the integrity of the Republic of Ecuador.” They stated that Kaplan’s “unfounded commentary”, against a “sovereign democracy”, was based on “unreliable evidence”. The Ecuadorian court charged that Kaplan relied almost exclusively on one Vladimiro Álvarez Grau, an avowed political opponent of the Ecuadorian government. “Chevron sought out a favorable forum,” the Ecuadorian court wrote. “The District Court [Kaplan], fulfilling Chevron’s wishes, chose to make far-reaching judgments based primarily on the opinions of a single partisan.”

Finally, the Ecuadorian court confirmed that Chevron Corporation remained responsible for the impact of its pollution. “In 2005,” the court wrote, “ChevronTexaco dropped the name ‘Texaco’ and reverted to its original name, Chevron Corporation. There is no indication in the record before us that shortening its name had any effect on ChevronTexaco’s legal obligations. Chevron Corporation therefore remains accountable.”

Furthermore, in a separate discovery hearing, the US Third Circuit court cautioned: “The circumstances supporting [Chevron’s] claim of fraud largely are allegations and allegations are not factual findings.”

This historic SLAPP lawsuit, possibly the most expensive in history, appears to have failed, even after Kaplan’s decision. Foreign courts have ignored Kaplan’s injunction, and Donziger and his clients are making progress in Canadian courts, where the victims are attempting to collect the Ecuadorian judgment by seizing Chevron Canada’s assets, and where they have won three consecutive unanimous appellate court decisions. Donziger and the Ecuadorian villagers have said they would welcome Chevron to claim in Canada that the Ecuadorian judgment was fraudulent. “If they had to bring Guerra to Canada before a neutral judge,” says Donziger, “we believe the company’s entire RICO narrative will collapse.”

SLAPP suits represent a threat to public protest and free speech. They have no place in a democracy.

3,"Exxon Mobil, other oil companies and a number of other corporate giants announced on Tuesday that they are supporting a plan to tax carbon emissions that was put forth this year by a group of Republican elder statesmen.

The group, the Climate Leadership Council, unveiled a “conservative climate solution” in February that would fight global warming by taxing greenhouse gas emissions and returning the money to taxpayers as a “climate dividend.” The underlying idea is that, by making energy derived from fossil fuels more expensive, the free market will move more quickly and effectively toward renewable energy and other low-carbon solutions.

Exxon Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total S.A. publicly backed the plan on Tuesday, and they have a number of reasons to lend their support. The plan calls for scrapping Obama-era regulations intended to fight climate change, arguing that a market-driven approach will have the same effect in reducing emissions as the regulations would.

The oil giants could simply pass the cost of new taxes on to customers. And to protect American companies, the plan would introduce so-called border adjustments, intended to increase the cost of goods coming from nations that do not have a similar carbon tax."
4,"It was a bit rough around the edges but the staging of the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited Super Sevens Series sought to do one thing – it brought back life in the game that was virtually non-existent for a good number of years due to political differences amongst those that wanted to manage the PNG Rugby Union.

The game was virtually at a standstill, corporate sponsors were hesitant to come onboard, no more than five associations were running a competition and only several privately run seven’s tournaments were being staged like the Sports Tok Sevens that was keeping the code afloat.

Kudos to Sports Tok Sevens owners Benson Upas and Elsie Passingan for their personal initiative and to remain committed during tough economical times to stage the tournament.

With this year’s tournament set for June 11-13, am sure NCD residents will be in for another treat.

Unlike the Super Sevens Series, all 17 provincial teams were flown into the Nation’s Capital, accommodated, fed and all players, officials and referees were upgraded on their knowledge of the game with training provided by the PNGRU High Performance staff.

Not only that the players got to play at a world class facility at the refurbished Sir Hubert Murray Stadium.

You got to hand it to the PNGRU for pulling that off, despite the challengers that came with it.

Having to attract a major sponsor in KPHL for K10 million over three years, plus support sponsors in the National Capital District Commission, National Gaming Control Board and Air Nuigini …was a much needed coup that the game needed.

Past provincial teams never had that luxury, as they had to pay their own way, pay for their own accommodation and food as well.

So despite some of the issues that arose over the past three weeks, the women should be the only ones with a gripe.

From the teams, the expected teams from renown sevens playing centres like Morobe and West New Britain stood apart, Capital Rugby Union took two weekends to warm-up but managed to get out of the 15s mode, AROB Black Orchids, New Ireland Drongos, Central Warimos, NCD Dagwalas, Daru Stingrays and Gulf Saukuru showed they will be a threat in the future, while huge improvements from Sepik, Alotau, Goroka, Oro, Mendi, Madang and Mount Hagen, will certainly make for a more evenly contested challenge next year.

So in essence the PNGRU did deliver and after an assessment is made of the last three weekends by PNGRU Competition Manager Paul Joseph, CEO Sailosi Druma and President Paul Siwi, they will be better for it next year.

If you have a garage, attic, basement, or summerhouse, there’s every chance that you use it as an extra storage space rather than as a working room.

Brian Thompson’s garage was just like that, until he decided to turn it into a space fit for any witch or wizard worth their salt.

As the self-confessed ‘world’s biggest Harry Potter fan’ he used charity shop-bought products and objects destined for the tip to make a dull garage into a Hogwarts-inspired hideaway.

The 30-year-old used items picked up items from charity shops, Amazon and eBay to create the look, with the total coming in at just under £500.

Sharing his story with the moneysaving website LovetheSales.com, Brian said: ‘Since I was a kid, I’ve always been obsessed with Harry Potter. I just love how you can feel like you’re entering a new world that was created purely out of human imagination.

‘On my first visit to the Harry Potter studio tour, I fell in love with stepping inside the world of Harry Potter, seeing the sets and how they were designed was an amazing experience.

Brian says the project helped his mental health through lockdown (Picture: LovetheSales.com/Jam Press)

‘When we went into lockdown, I knew that this was my opportunity to try and recreate the same experience in my home.

‘I hated waking up to the same old spaces in my house, so I went to work creating my own little magical hideaway.

The incredible room looks just like Hogwarts (Picture: LovetheSales.com/Jam Press)

‘I started with the stars on the ceiling and after that, I couldn’t stop, two months later I had my very own Hogwarts.’

Crafty Brian used lots of everyday objects that would usually be thrown away, including foam packaging that came with products he ordered.

He used mostly items destined to be thrown out (Picture: LovetheSales.com/Jam Press)

He said: ‘To build the structure for my tree, I painted pool noodles to create details for the walls.

‘I’ve noticed heaps of new stuff in charity shops, people must be clearing out a lot of unwanted possessions, which was great news for me.

‘I picked up some real bargains, the photo frames were all £1 each and my display cabinet was £3.

‘With the grandfather clock, instead of buying a new one for hundreds, I bought the shell of an old grandfather clock for £8 from a charity shop and then put a moving 3D clock puzzle inside it that I got from Amazon for £46.’

To anyone else thinking of delving into a DIY project, Brian said: ‘I’d urge anyone who has a dream project in mind to use this time stuck inside to start it!

6,"London — Shell Chemicals' Moerdijk petrochemical plant in the Netherlands suffered a ""factory failure"" on Aug. 12 which forced it to flare, with units subsequently restarted in the same evening, a company source told S&P Global Platts Aug. 14.

""We can confirm the fact that Shell Moerdijk is flaring due to a factory failure,"" the company spokesman said. ""We have identified the cause of the failure, allowing us to restart the factory. The full restart takes a few days, with the flaring gradually decreasing.""

There was a limited market impact on the olefins market in Europe from the outage, according to market sources.

Earlier in the year, Shell postponed planned maintenance works at the Moerdijk facility until after the summer due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on availability of personnel. Market sources said the works are expected to take place around mid-September and will proceed as planned.

The Moerdijk cracker has the capacity to produce around 910,000 mt/year of ethylene, 510,000 mt/year of propylene and 115,000 mt/year of butadiene, according to data from S&P Global Platts Analytics.

In addition, the company produces 500,000 mt/year of benzene, 1 million mt/year of styrene and 155,000 mt/year of ethylene glycols.

Although there was limited impact on most aromatics and olefins prices from the flaring, one monoethylene glycols distributor said it was revising its offers in light of the Moerdijk issues in an already tight European MEG market.

""I'm pulling my offers from market. I hear shell might not be offering MEG for a few days,"" a trader said Aug. 13.

MEG supply in Europe had become more limited with a generalized reduction in US production in recent months, tightening supply there. The dependence of European MEG consumers on US resupply increased in recent years based on the new capacities there. With the tighter supply, any import vessels are not expected to arrive until the end of August at the earliest.

Spot FCA trucks were heard trading as high as Eur580/mt FCA Antwerp in the week, up from the Aug. 7 assessment of Eur505/mt FCA NWE, its highest level since Nov. 1, 2019, according to Platts data."
7,"Follow our live coverage of the COP27 Climate Summit in Egypt.

SHARM EL SHEIKH — World leaders gathered Monday to wrestle with the crisis of climate change, amid a sea of other pressing challenges that threaten to set back already inadequate steps to pivot the global economy away from fossil fuels.

Casting an ominous shadow over these talks is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, itself financed by the sale of Russian gas. The conflict has unsettled the global energy market, spurred inflation and led some to call for more oil and gas drilling. Meanwhile, poor countries suffering from climate effects are increasingly frustrated with wealthy countries whose emissions are driving global warming. And relations between the two biggest polluters, the United States and China, have fallen to a new low.

“We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,” the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, told the gathering of more than 100 princes, presidents, and prime ministers Monday at the summit, the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations climate convention, known as COP27.

Scattered amid the sprawling conference center were several pavilions dedicated to the promotion of oil and gas. Saudi Arabia had paid for an exceptionally large space to describe itself as an energy hub. OPEC had a space showing off what it called its international development fund. Mauritania boasted of its natural gas reserves."
8,"March 24, 2022 (IEEFA)—Four key conditions have changed to make the construction of a massive Louisiana petrochemical plant even less viable over the past year, according to a study by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Th Sunshine Project being considered for development by Formosa Plastics is increasingly threatened by rising construction prices, more intense regulatory scrutiny, increased community opposition, and withering credit agency support, IEEFA found in its update of a 2021 report.

“The company has not yet made a final investment decision to proceed with the Louisiana project,” said Abhishek Sinha, an IEEFA petrochemicals analyst and an author of the report. “But on- and off-balance sheet issues are converging to make the project less likely to move forward.”

Regulatory hurdles also continue to plague the project. Suzanne Mattei, an IEEFA energy policy analyst and co-author of the report, said an environmental impact statement is likely to have to address the issue of water pollution caused by discharges of plastic pellets; a federal judge recently ordered Formosa to resume cleaning waters contaminated by its petrochemical complex in Port Comfort, Texas.

Market factors also make the Formosa plant a poor investment. The project, which would manufacture several types of plastic resins with ethane as its feedstock, may suffer from volatile polyethylene prices. Polyethylene prices hit record levels last year but appear to have peaked; spikes since then have been driven by temporary factors such as rising oil and gas prices, inflation, and market turmoil. In addition, IEEFA found the market for Formosa products is oversupplied.

“The pandemic and current disruptions in the market have created confusing business signals, and the rate at which the market can absorb capacity additions is uncertain,” said Tom Sanzillo, IEEFA director of financial analysis and a co-author of the report. “Market fundamentals suggest that the oversupply will push prices down, which makes going forward with the project unlikely.”

The IEEFA analysis finds that a 10 percent increase in the price of ethane used as feedstock, coupled with a 10 percent decline in ethylene prices, would reduce Formosa margins by half. The financial outlook has become so bleak that Standard & Poor’s determined delays in the project have benefitted, rather than hurt, the company’s credit rating.

“Key financial decisions affecting the proposed Formosa complex have deteriorated over the past year,” said Sanzillo. “The recent credit opinion issued by S&P reflects the growing view among members of the financial community that the Louisiana project is a poor investment.”

9,"The Nigerian House and Senate passed slightly different but generally same versions of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) last week. It’s a huge deal. When writing this article, the two versions are yet to be harmonized and sent to President Buhari. However, we must understand the main tenents.

What is the PIB?

The PIB is omnibus legislation first introduced by President Olusegun Obasanjo 20 years ago to review and amend legislation, laws, and practices in Nigeria’s crude and gas sector. Specifically, the consolidated Bill seeks to review fiscal terms, cost-sharing and increase the federation’s share from oil and gas assets while reducing direct ownership. It will also create new regulatory bodies to address host community agitations and position the Nigerian oil and gas sector as more dynamic and efficient.

Why is the PIB important?

Ike Kachikwu, former Minister of State for Petroleum, said the non-passage of the PIB costs Nigeria N3 trillion a year. Nigeria’s oil and gas sector generates up to 90% of Nigerian Foreign Exchange earnings. According to Dr Doyin Salami, Nigeria is an “oil dependant nation,” meaning that Nigeria will struggle to meet obligations without the forex revenues generated from crude oil and gas.

What is in this PIB?

Make NNPC more efficient and transparent by transiting it to NNPC Limited within six months of the Bill’s passage. NNPC Limited can raise outside capital and publish the annual audited report. It will then be solely a commercial entity.

Improve regulation of the sector by creating just two regulators – the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (the ‘Commission’) and the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (the ‘Authority’). These two will replace the multitude of regulating bodies in the sector. The regulators will have no commercial role, allowing them to perform oversight.

New taxes : The current Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT) will be split into two, namely: a new Hydrocarbon Tax (HT) and Companies Income Tax (CIT). The HT and CIT will apply to companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations on a company-wide rather than contract area basis. Petroleum Invest Allowance is gone.

The HT and CIT will apply to companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations on a company-wide rather than contract area basis. Petroleum Invest Allowance is gone. Host Community Development Fund: The PIB established a Host Communities Development Trust which will oversee all Environmental, Social and Infrastructure projects in the communities where oil and gas assets are located.

The PIB established a Host Communities Development Trust which will oversee all Environmental, Social and Infrastructure projects in the communities where oil and gas assets are located. Upgrade environmental and social components by creating an Environmental Remediation Fund. The PIB will also require Environmental Management Plan where an Environmental Impact Assessment is needed and stop using chemicals in the upstream sector unless a permit is granted.

Gas Flaring: PIB prohibits gas flaring or venting and imposes a fine that is not eligible for cost recovery. The gas production licensee must submit an elimination and monetizing plan for gas within one year of passage.

The PIB is a very complex bill, and I have to do another article just on the tax and operational parts. I want to focus this week on the framework and the Host Community Development Fund.

The Host Community Development (HCDF)

This controversy over the HCDF is a crucial reason why the PIB has not passed prior; the bickering resembled tribal rather than fiscal issues. This HCDF is an essential part of the Bill and may be the only part Nigerians can relate to because of its direct effect.

Set-up

Unlike the 13% derivation payment, which involves payments going from the Consolidated Revenue Fund directly to the State Executive via FAAC transfers, the PIB requires a ‘Settlor” (oil company) to incorporate an HCDT. The Settlor will then appoint and authorize a Board of Trustees (BOT) registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The Settlor will, in effect, set the constitution and memoranda of the HCDT BOT, and they will agree to regulations, qualifications and all matters relating to the BOT.

Needs assessment

The Settlor will then conduct a needs assessment of the community and develop a plan to address these needs. This is to be done within 12 months of the passage of the PIB

Management and advisory

The HCDT BoT will set up a management committee that comprises one representative of each host community as a non-executive member. The management committee will “prepare the fund’s budget, manage project awards on behalf of the Trust, supervise project execution, and other functions that may be assigned to it by the BoT.”

The management community will set up an advisory committee in accordance with the constitution of the BoT. The committee will be responsible for “nominating members to represent the host communities on the management committee, communicating community development projects to the management committee, monitoring the progress of community projects, securing project facilities, and advising the management committee on measures to improve security and peace within the community.”

Funding

The PIB requires each settlor to contribute a percentage of its actual operating expenditure in the preceding calendar year to a fund established by the Trust.

75% of the annual contribution shall fund capital projects while 5% is for administrative costs. 20% is retained as a reserve fund and invested in utilizing the Trust when contributions from the Settlor cease.

Operations

The Settlor will pay directly to the Operator appointed annually to execute the projects in the needs assessment. The annual payment by the Settlor is tax deductable from HT and CIT.

Penalty

“The host community will forfeit its entitlement to any contribution to the extent of the cost to repair damages to the petroleum and designated facilities or disruption to production activities within the host community caused by an act of vandalism, sabotage or civil unrest.”

This part of the Bill is brilliantly written legislatively. My only question is, who is a host community? Is it where the crude oil is? Where there are pipelines? Refineries and deports? All of the above?

In summary, Shell JV will create Shell Community Development Fund, for instance. Shell will then receive nominations from host communities on prospective BOT members; Shell will incorporate the BOT in the CAC and fund the BOT through the appointed operators. The Advisory Committee will work with Shell to approve needs assessment and communicate the progress of contracts back to the community. The Operator can use up to 75% for CAPEX. If any pipeline is broken in the community, Shell will debit its contribution to the BOT.

If this works, Nigeria will see less pipeline vandalism as the hosts now have a direct stake in the oil and gas sector, and consequently, this should see an uptick in volumes pumped and revenues flowing to the federation.

Next week, I will look at specific fiscal and operational issues the PIB will bring

Do follow."
10,"“All the risks would have been captured or will be captured in the due diligence of the potential buyers. There may be some delay due to the court injunctions and potential need to negotiate with the community, but this will not halt the deal,” he says.

READ MORE Nigeria’s PIB may to be too late to help buyers of Shell assets

This stance is corroborated by Uwa Osadiaye, a senior vice president and oil and gas analyst at FBNQuest, who argues that since the decision to sell is from Shell Global, due to its energy transition and asset portfolio optimisation plans, the company will not think twice about selling, especially considering how their Nigerian onshore assets are comparatively expensive and inefficient to operate.

“Oil companies were ready to write off value in Russia at the beginning of the conflict. Paying compensation to host communities to achieve their energy transition goal is much easier,” he says.

Asset sale

Last month, there were reports that Shell Global, after receiving bids from at least four indigenous oil companies, had reached the final stages of their Nigerian asset sale process.

One of the reasons Shell is disposing these onshore assets in the first place is because of community issues

The oil giant had announced last year that it wanted to sell its Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) subsidiary, a joint venture that runs the company’s shallow-water and onshore asset interests and where Royal Dutch Shell owns 30% equity.

It stirred mixed feelings because, on the one hand, it highlights the exodus of global players in the Nigerian oil sector due to incessant sabotage and oil theft, as well as the global energy transition away from fossil fuels.

On the other hand, it signals the success of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which has provided a framework and energised indigenous players to acquire key oil assets or invest in new ones in the country.

However on 16 June 2022, Nigeria’s Supreme Court ruled that Shell and its host communities should maintain the “status quo” until November, when it is ready to rule on the “contentious” appeal brought before it by Shell: up to 88 communities of Egbalor Ebubu in the oil rich Rivers State are suing the oil giant and are seeking compensation for a 2019 oil spill in the communities.

“One of the reasons Shell is disposing [of] these onshore assets in the first place is because of community issues,” says the source. “Community issues should not be a deal breaker for such a landmark transaction. It will be resolved.”

Held to account

As Osadiye says, this may be the last time that Shell can be held to account. “If not now, they never will. It is only appropriate that the instrument of law is being used to hold Shell accountable considering the scale of damage oil exploration has wreaked on these communities that cannot fish or farm because their lands are poisoned,” he says.

READ MORE Nigeria’s silent killer: The deadly price of oil

Although Shell has repeatedly denied its involvement and ascribed the spill to attacks by local oil thieves, a federal high court ruled in November 2020 that Shell pay the communities N800bn ($1.95bn) in compensation.

Shell immediately filed an appeal at a Court of Appeal in Owerri, Imo State, southeastern Nigeria. In March this year, the Appeal Court upheld the decision of the lower court, that Shell pay the compensation. It also added a deadline for the payment.

“The Justices [of the Appeal Court] wanted Shell to deposit that huge sum into a designated court account within 48 hours,” a senior lawyer familiar with the case, but who prefers to be unnamed, tells The Africa Report.

“Of course, Shell couldn’t comply because it was impracticable to carry out, and the Court wanted to charge the directors of Shell for contempt of the court order to deposit,” they say.

The Court of Appeal also banned Shell, either by itself, via subsidiary or an agent from “selling, allocating, vandalising or disposing off” its assets until the appeal was determined. This meant that the onshore asset sale process that had already started was forced to pause.

The only major hurdle they may face is funding and they must have kickstarted that process before they started bidding.

Shell Companies in Nigeria are Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) and Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG). SPDC explores oil and gas from land, swamps and shallow waters in the Niger Delta, SNEPCo operates deep offshore in the Gulf of Guinea and SNG distributes gas within the country.

“As a result of this, the directors appealed to the Supreme Court against the contempt proceedings at the Court of Appeal and of course, the main judgement,” says the senior lawyer.

“We are encouraged by the recent Supreme Court ruling…We have a strong belief in the merit of our case and in the rule of law,” Bamidele Odugbesan, media relations manager at Shell Nigeria, tells The Africa Report.

However, because the recent Supreme Court judgement was only about the contempt proceedings, and not about the deal, Odugbesan believes the asset sale can go ahead.

Indeed the deal is only for a section of their assets in Nigeria as the company, says Odugbesan, and Shell “will continue to invest in the country to help meet its energy needs, with a focus to grow our deep water and gas positions.”

Oil spill

The 2019 oil spill issue has been a huge issue in Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta where most of the country’s exploration has been done. It has been the reason for many peaceful and armed agitations in the region for years. A prominent peaceful activist, Ken Saro Wiwa, was executed by Nigeria’s military regime in 1995.

Militant agitators have also sprung up in the region, leading to the Nigerian government establishing the amnesty programme and the Niger Delta Development Commission to address some of these issues. The newly signed Petroleum Industry Act also created a Host Community Fund to be taken from profits of oil companies, if it is certified that there are no attacks or sabotage on their assets in any financial year.

READ MORE Nigeria's new petroleum law is forging a new trajectory for natural gas

Most relevantly, the host communities are motivated because some of them have won legal cases against oil companies in the past.

However, even if it crosses the legal hurdle, Shell may still meet a regulatory brick wall. In 2019, the oil giant, along with other oil majors like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Eni, Total and Equinor, were hit with billions in back taxes by the Nigerian government. At nearly $20bn in total, each company was asked to pay at least $2.5bn to the government.

The Petroleum Industry Act is key to expanding the fortunes of Nigeria’s petroleum industry. It stands to remove the uncertainty that has led to a significant reduction in investment in exploration and production https://t.co/ZsU7fHyzvc — The Conversation Africa (@TC_Africa) September 3, 2021

The federal government demanded for the payment of the “outstanding royalties and taxes for oil and gas production,” after settling a dispute with the subnational governments over the distribution formula for revenue from hydrocarbon production.

The companies believed that it was a misunderstanding of a clause in the original production sharing contracts that they signed with the government years ago.

READ MORE Nigeria: Petroleum Industry Bill will not solve Niger Delta crisis

Meanwhile, in April this year, Shell was awarded by the federal government’s revenue collection agency, FIRS, as a leading tax compliant organisation in Nigeria for 2021. The company claims that it merited the award because it remitted over $6bn in taxes between 2015 and 2020.

It is for reasons such as this that Osadiaye believes that the oil giant won’t face any regulatory hurdles while selling its onshore and shallow water assets.

“The NNPC has just been incorporated in line with the newly signed PIA and they needed a key asset to themselves. The ExxonMobil asset was just right due its gas range and no incidence of violence or attacks. From a country perspective, it was very valuable and perhaps that’s why they stopped the deal!” Osadiaye says.

Investor interest

Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil company had already finalised the deal to acquire some ExxonMobil assets in the country, but it was stopped by the NNPC, citing national interest reasons and first-refusal principle. The national oil company has since made a counter-offer to ExxonMobil, local media reported.

READ MORE Nigeria: Seplat seeks to raise gas production to match surging demand

“These Shell assets on sale are also key, but are not as strategic as ExxonMobil’s so I see limited risks,” Osadiaye says.

Nevertheless, investor interest will remain, says Osadiaye. This is because unlike 25 years ago, interest in the sector has mainly been local. The sector has been witnessing a rise in the partnership between indigenous players and smaller or mid-sized oil companies that are familiar with the terrain and understand what the issues are.

They are expected to wait till the case is concluded in order to avoid operating in a restive or angry host community, but the interests will remain and “are going nowhere”, says Osadiaye

“The only major hurdle they may face is funding and they must have kickstarted that process before they started bidding. I expect the funding to come from organisations like Afreximbank, AfDB and even countries like China. The capital and interests in this kind of deal are patient and the funders are generally less sensitive,” he says."
11,"SINGAPORE — A 38-year-old man was sentenced to four months’ jail for accepting bribes totalling US$15,000 (S$20,500), as part of a decade-long alleged multi-million marine fuel heist from Shell Eastern Petroleum's Pulau Bukom refinery.

Jasbir Singh Paramjit Singh, who appeared in court on Tuesday (Nov 15), was also ordered to pay a fine of S$20,514 for his offences.

He pleaded guilty earlier on Nov 4 to one charge under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He, along with 11 other people from the same company, were charged in April with accepting bribes which amounted to at least US$213,000.

At the time of the incidences, Singh was a surveyor employed by Intertek Testing Services, a company that offered surveying services of the quantity of cargo supplied to vessels in Singapore.

They had allegedly accepted the bribes as “inducement or rewards for refraining from accurately reporting the amount of oil loaded onto vessels which their respective companies were engaged by Shell to inspect”, CPIB said in a press release in April.

Between 2014 and 2017, they accepted the bribes directly or through intermediaries from three former employees of Shell — Juandi Pungot, Muzaffar Ali Khan Muhamad Akram and Richard Goh — who are said to have been the key planners of the scheme which began in 2007.

Juandi was jailed for 29 years on March 31 while Muzaffar and and Goh's cases are pending.

WHAT HAPPENED

Around 2013, Juandi and Muzaffar approached Singh to discuss how they could work together in order to sell misappropriated Shell gas oil to vessels docked at Shell Pulau Bukom.

Pulau Bukom is a pair of islands and all fuel products leave the site via underwater pipelines or by vessels.

Singh agreed to help them. Three of his colleagues — A Duraisamy, Noruliman Bakti and Anand Omprekas — were also roped in to assist with the plan.

Duraisamy, Noruliman and Anand were sentenced earlier to 10 months, eight months and six months' jail respectively.

The four of them would turn a blind eye to the theft of gas oil and would also inaccurately report the amount of cargo loaded onto the vessels which Intertek was engaged to inspect.

In return, they would receive a sum of money from Muzaffar and Juandi.

Between 2014 and 2015, Singh accepted bribes on three occasions from Juandi, which amounted to US$15,000.

On each occasion, Duraisamy first received the US$15,000 before splitting the sum equally with Noruliman and Singh, such that they would each receive around US$5,000.

According to court documents, their actions resulted in a misappropriation of Shell gas oil worth US$567,842.

For accepting a bribe, Singh could have been jailed up to five years or fined up to S$100,000, or both."

13,"According to the filing, Shur led a $120 million deal code-named Project Heron from her hospital bed while recovering from surgeries at Memorial Sloan Kettering. The petition quotes emails from twelve of her coworkers who sent Shur emails praising her job performance, leadership, mentoring style, and soft skills. Shell highlighted the Project Heron deal as a key divestment milestone in its Fourth Quarter results to institutional investors in January 2020. In May 2020, she received a Special Recognition Award payment for her outstanding work. Shur was medically cleared and returned to work on June 15, 2020, only to be terminated on June 25, 2020, and told it was for “performance reasons.”

“I worked from my hospital bed to get Project Heron signed and closed because I wanted part of my legacy to be one of professionalism and success, if I died,” Shur said, “To be terminated ten days after my return to work despite successfully completing Project Heron is mind-boggling to me.”

Shur’s lawyer, Mark Oberti, Oberti Sullivan LLP, stated that “evidence shows that an insecure male manager of Shur’s who was less accomplished, less connected, and less knowledgeable in her field had been waiting to activate a plan to illegally fire Shur. When she was stricken with cancer, he seized on that opportunity to launch his scheme.”

Oberti said: “Shell’s Code of Conduct states that its core values are “honesty,” “respect” and “integrity.” We don’t believe that firing a cancer victim who earned Shell $160+ million is consistent with these values. We believe it is consistent with illegal discrimination and think a jury will too.

A judge granted Shur’s request of preferential trial setting to begin on October 2, 2022.

14,"Datasets

We define a data point as a pair of an image and its corresponding label. Real dataset denotes real images taken from experiment with manually annotated labels; simulated dataset refers to Monte Carlo Potts simulated images with labels directly extracted from the simulations; synthetic dataset denotes synthetic images generated from our image style transfer model with corresponding simulated labels. Segmentation models trained with different data sets are used to provide predicted labels for a separated test images obtain from experiment. Throughout the paper, we consider the manually annotated labels as ground true (or true labels) because these are the best references we can get and we have confirmed the consistency of results between different experts.

Real dataset

The real dataset contains a total of 136 serial section optical images of polycrystalline iron with a resolution of 2800 × 1600 pixels, of which the ground truth has 2 semantic classes (grain and grain boundary) and is manually labeled by material scientists. The dataset is randomly split into 100 training and 36 test data. The original images were pre-processed into small images (patches) with a size of 400 × 400 pixels in order to reduce the computational burden. Finally, the training set consists of 2800 patches with resolution of 400 × 400 pixels, cropped from the original 100 training images, while the test set consists of 1008 patches cropped from the 36 test images. The test data is separated at the beginning of our experiment and is not used for any of the model training, including the image style transfer models and segmentation models.

Simulated dataset

We established a large 3D simulated model of the polycrystalline materials using the Monte Carlo Potts model. Then, 2D images were obtained by slicing a simulated 3D image in the normal direction (Fig. 1d). Finally, we retained only the boundary pixels of each grain to obtain the labels for the simulated 2D images (Fig. 1e). The final simulated dataset contains a total of 28,800 images, which was one order of magnitude greater than the real dataset. During the simulation process, we ensured that the geometric and topological information of the simulated data was statistically consistent with that of the real image. However, the simulated data contains only grain boundary information with no defects or noises. For the real images, the range of pixel values of the grain boundary obtained by optical microscopy was [0, 255], and the specific pixel value was affected by grain appearance, the light intensity of the microscope and noise introduced during the sample preparation. For the simulated 2D images, the range of pixel values was [0, N], with N denoting the total number of grains in the 3D simulated model, which was controlled by the grain-growth simulation model. The pixel values are basically the identification numbers for the grains. Simulated data cannot be directly used in machine learning-based algorithms because there are differences in the nature of real and simulated data.

Synthetic dataset

We trained our image style transfer model using real dataset. Then, we applied our model to transform all the labels images of the simulated 2D images (simulated label) into synthetic images. As shown in Fig. 3, there are four columns of images: from left to right are real image, simulated image, simulated label and synthetic image. The synthetic image has both label information and an “image style” similar to those of the real image. It can be used as data augmentation for the real data in data mining or machine learning tasks.

Fig. 3: The demonstration of different datasets. From left to right are the real image, simulated image, simulated label, and synthetic image. Full size image

We compare the time consumption of the two image production methods, i.e., experiment and synthetization, in Table 1. Due to the complex experimental procedures, including sample preparation, polishing, etching, and photographing, the real image takes the longest time, ~1200 s per image. It should be noted that we do not consider the increase in time cost caused by failed experiments. In reality, the experimental process is likely to require even longer time.

Table 1 Manufacture time of two procedures. Full size table

Table 2 Contingency table. Full size table

The preparation of synthetic dataset includes three steps: the design and construction of simulation model, the training of style transfer model, and the generation of synthetic image. By virtue of a high-speed computer system, the construction of simulation model cost only 1% of the experimental time, ~12 s per simulated data. And the training of style transfer model cost ~23 h, which translated to ~3 s per synthetic image. Note that the training time of style transfer model depends on the volume of training data. In practice, a smaller training set could be enough to obtain a reasonably good model, meaning that a shorter time would be needed. Finally, when we have a trained style transfer model, the generation of one synthetic image takes ~0.1 s during the inference of the generative adversarial network. As a result, the time cost of setting up a synthetic dataset is approximated 1% of the time cost of getting experimental data.

Evaluation models and metrics

Model setting

There are two deep learning-based models in our experiment: image style transfer model and image segmentation model.

For image style transfer model, we used pix2pix23 to transform simulated label to synthetic image and the detail structure can be found in latter section. During the training stage, we set the batch size equal to 8 and optimized the model by Adam with an initial learning rate of 2 × 10−4 in 200 epochs.

For image segmentation model, U-net28 is the most commonly used supervised learning method in the field of materials and medical image processing29. Therefore, we used U-net as our baseline to compare with data augmentation algorithms. U-net is an encoder–decoder network; the input goes through a series of convolution-pooling-normalization group layers until it reaches the bottleneck layer, where the underlying information is shared with the output. U-net joins the layer-skip connection to transfer the features extracted from the down-sampling layers directly to the upper sampling layers, thus making the pixel location of the network more accurate. During the training stage, we jointly trained the model on real and synthetic dataset using batch gradient descent with mini-batches of 8 images, including 4 real and 4 synthetic images, which is the same process used in the work18. It took 28,000 iterations to converge with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4. Although the training pattern is important for network training, this paper does not discuss this issue because it is beyond the scope of our topic. All models were trained with the same pattern to ensure fairness.

Metrics

Grain segmentation is an instance segmentation (or dense segmentation) task. A successful algorithm has to detect and depart each grain in an image. For example, there are ~57 grains in each 400 × 400 real image. Based on the segmentation results, researchers can extract size and shape distribution of grains from the image to build the relationship between microstructure and macroscopic material performance. In practice, different types of noises are introduced to a sample during the preparation step, which seriously influences the grain segmentation algorithms. We should choose an effective metrics to evaluate the performance of algorithms in this task. Discussion of different image segmentation metrics is included in Supplementary Note 1 with Supplementary Fig. 1. We decided to use two effective metrics to evaluate our algorithm: mean average precision (MAP)30,31 and adjusted rand index (ARI)32,33,34.

MAP is a classical measure in image segmentation and object detection tasks. In this paper, we evaluate it at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds. The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as:

$${\mathrm{IoU}}(A,B) = \frac{{A \cap B}}{{A \cup B}}$$ (1)

The metric sweeps over a range of IoU thresholds at each point, calculating an average precision value. The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05: (0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95). In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a “hit” if its IoU with a ground truth object is >0.5. Generally, it can be considered that the segment is correct when its IoU is >0.5. The other higher value is aimed at ensuring the correct results.

At each threshold value t, a precision value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects. The average precision of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above precision values at each IoU threshold.

$${\mathrm{Average}}\,{\mathrm{precision}} = \frac{1}{{|{\mathrm{thresholds}}|}}\mathop {\sum}\limits_t {\frac{{{\mathrm{TP}}(t)}}{{{\mathrm{TP}}\left( t \right) + {\mathrm{FP}}\left( t \right) + {\mathrm{FN}}(t)}}}$$ (2)

Finally, the MAP score returned by the metric is the mean taken over the individual average precisions of each image in the test set.

ARI is the corrected-for-chance version of the rand index (RI), which is a measure of the similarity between two data clustering methods32,33,34. From a mathematical standpoint, ARI or RI is related to accuracy. In addition, image segmentation can be considered a clustering task that splits all pixels in an image into n partitions or segments.

Given a set S of n elements (pixels) and two groupings or partitions of these elements, namely, X = {X 1 , X 2 , …, X r } (a partition of S into r subsets) and Y = {Y 1 , Y 2 , …, X S } (a partition of S into s subsets), the overlap between X and Y can be summarized in a contingency table [n ij ] (see Table 2), where each entry n ij denotes the number of objects in common between X i and Y j : \(n_{ij} = |X_i \cap Y_j|\). For the image segmentation task, X and Y can be treated as ground truth and predicted result, respectively.

The ARI is defined as follows:

$$\overbrace {{\mathrm{ARI}}}^{{\mathrm{Adjusted}}\,{\mathrm{rand}}\,{\mathrm{index}}} = \frac{{\mathop {\sum}

olimits_{ij} {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {n_{ij}} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} - \left[ {\mathop {\sum}

olimits_i {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {a_i} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} \mathop {\sum}

olimits_j {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {b_j} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} } \right]{\mathrm{/}}\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} n \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)}}{{\frac{1}{2}\left[ {\mathop {\sum}

olimits_i {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {a_i} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} + \mathop {\sum}

olimits_j {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {b_j} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} } \right] - \left[ {\mathop {\sum}

olimits_i {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {a_i} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} \mathop {\sum}

olimits_j {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {b_j} \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)} } \right]{\mathrm{/}}\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} n \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)}}$$ (3)

where n ij , a i , b j are values from the contingency table and \(\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} n \\ 2 \end{array}} \right)\) is calculated as n(n − 1)/2.

The MAP is a strict and effective metric because it is the mean score of each threshold, so the score is always smaller than the ARI.

For all models, the higher the metrics, the better the model is. For fair comparison, all the models were evaluated on the same real test set initially separated out from the training process.

Our implementation of this algorithm was derived from the publicly available Python35, Pytorch framework36, and OpenCV toolbox37. The image style transfer model and U-net’s training and testing were performed on Nvidia DGX Station using 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 128 GB memory.

Image segmentation by the proposed augmentation method

First, we compared the performance of three conventional image processing algorithms; a threshold-based method called OTSU38, a boundary-based method called Canny39 and a morphology-based method called Watershed40. Second, we chose K-means41 as a representative for unsupervised learning method. Third, we chose U-net as a representative for deep learning method (Real 100% in Table 3). As shown in Table 3, due to the high capability of feature extraction, the U-net achieves the best performance compared with unsupervised learning method and traditional image processing algorithms. And some visualization results can be found in Supplementary Note 2 with Supplementary Fig. 2.

Table 3 The performance of different methods in image segmentation. Full size table

Finally, we explored the use of a simulated dataset as data augmentation to replace the real dataset for training a neural network. As shown in Table 3, using the same real test set initially separated out from the training, we compared the performance of the model trained on the whole training set of real data, named the Real 100% dataset, and the performance on the whole simulated dataset, named the Simulated 100% dataset. The subscript denotes the percentage of the specific dataset used in the training set. We found that simply using the Simulated 100% dataset achieved poor performance when compared with the Real 100% dataset. In addition, the performance was degraded when we mixed these two datasets as a training set. We assume that there are two possible reasons. One possibility is that we did not have sufficient simulated data to achieve proper model training. However, additional experiments (Supplementary Table 1) shown in Supplementary Note 3 indicated that models trained with simulated data performed very well on the simulated test data, so we ruled out this possibility. The other reason could be that the simulated data were unrealistic, i.e., containing only grain boundary information without any defects that may appear in real images. This problem can be addressed by the image style transfer model.

We used the image style transfer model to create synthetic image by fusing the pixel-level label of simulated label and the “image style” information of real image. We believe that this processing will make the simulated data more realistic and could be used as data augmentation for real data in material data mining.

We evaluated the performance of the image style transfer model using MAP and ARI. There are two stages in our approach; image style transfer and image segmentation, both of which need to be trained. The main motivation of our study is to reduce the demand of real data for training the segmentation network. Therefore, we started our experiment from using only 5% of the whole real datasets and increased the amount by 5% until we reached the same performance as the Real 100% case. First, we used the selected amount of real data to train an image style transfer model. Then, we used the trained image style transfer model to convert all images of simulated label to a set of synthetic images. The simulated labels and synthetic images form the synthetic dataset, denoted as \({\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{5{\mathrm{\% }}}\) if we used 5% real data. The superscript in \({\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{5{\mathrm{\% }}}\) denotes the proportion of real dataset used to train the style transfer model and the subscript of Real 5% or \({\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{5{\mathrm{\% }}}\) denotes the proportion of real or synthetic dataset, respectively, used to train the segmentation network.

We show the performance of model trained with synthetic dataset in Table 4. We compared the performance with models trained on real dataset and a mixture of both. We found that the case of using mixed dataset performed better than the case of using only real dataset. If we have only 5% of the real dataset, the performance will increase by ~8% on MAP and 10% on ARI after using the synthetic dataset as data augmentation. This finding suggests that using synthetic dataset as data augmentation will bring significant performance improvement, especially when there is only a small amount of real data.

Table 4 Performance of synthetic dataset used as data augmentation in image segmentation. Full size table

As shown in Table 4, with the increase in the amount of real data, the performance of the models improved for both cases (using only the real data or using the mixed data for training). When we used 35% of the real data, the performance (MAP is 0.586 and ARI is 0.875) of the case of mixed training (Real 35% + \({\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{35{\mathrm{\% }}}\)) achieved competitive performance to the case of using the whole real data (Real 100% ) in both metrics. This finding proves that our method can significantly reduce the amount of real data in image segmentation (around 65% in this case), which means reducing the pressure of obtaining and labeling real images from costly experiment. In order to demonstrate the statistical significance of resulted values, we have conducted extra tests to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the performance of our best model (see Supplementary Note 4 with Supplementary Table 2).

The visualization of image segmentation is shown in Fig. 4. From left to right are real image, manually annotated label, the results of model training with Real 35% and the results of model training with mixed data (\({\mathrm{Real}}_{35{\mathrm{\% }}} + {\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{35{\mathrm{\% }}}\)). The orange rectangles and their magnified results (shown in upper left of the figure) denote the areas in which the model trained with small real data cannot close the grain boundary, but the model trained with data augmentation can segment those areas correctly. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method improves the performance in terms of quantitative assessment and result visualization.

From left to right are real image, manually annotated label (ground truth), the result of model training with Real 35% , and the result of model training with \({\mathrm{Mixed}}({\mathrm{Real}}_{35{\mathrm{\% }}} + {\mathrm{Synthetic}}_{100{\mathrm{\% }}}^{35{\mathrm{\% }}})\). Full size image

In addition, we compare the performance of our data augmentation strategy with traditional augmentation methods (such as rotation and flipping) and pre-training method (Ternausnet42) in Supplementary Notes 5 and 6 with Supplementary Tables 3, 4, respectively. We confirmed that our proposed augmentation method provides extra improvement to the segmentation task on top of the traditional data augmentation methods. Furthermore, the typical pre-training method (e.g., Ternausnet) did not achieve the same level of improvement as our proposed method did."
15,"BODO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell wants to reweight its footprint in Nigeria to focus on oil and gas fields far offshore, away from the theft, spills, corruption and unrest that have plagued the West African country’s onshore industry for decades.

Graphic: Oil spills at Shell's Nigeria operations - tmsnrt.rs/2KzACfH

But for the company that pioneered Nigeria’s oil industry in the 1950s, the Niger Delta remains as important -- and problematic -- as ever.

While Shell has cut onshore oil production and sold some onshore assets, it continues to invest in others. In fact, onshore production has risen in recent years as a share of Shell’s output in Nigeria, an analysis of company data over the past decade shows.

Graphic: Shell Nigeria production - tmsnrt.rs/2OB5wa0

Much of the increase comes from less polluting gas, used mainly in power generation, which Shell thinks will be key to the transition to lower carbon energy. Gas made up 70 percent of onshore production in 2017, up from 47 percent in 2008.

Graphic: Nigeria onshore production - tmsnrt.rs/2CLPxEU

The company still controls thousands of kilometers of pipelines connecting inland fields to coastal terminals through its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Co of Nigeria (SPDC), however.

So while SPDC has cut oil production in the Delta by 70 percent since 2011, when it first started reporting data on spills, the incidence of spills and theft from pipelines has fallen at a much lower rate and has picked up again recently, the data shows.

Shell’s Nigeria Country Chair Osagie Okunbor hinted it was a sensitive balancing act.

“We are too big just to see ourselves as ‘there is a problem and we have to run’. That is not what we are thinking of doing,” he told reporters on a media trip to the country in July. “But at the same time we don’t want to spread our footprint.”

Two pipeline spills in 2008 in the small community of Bodo in Ogoniland are emblematic of the problems in the Delta, a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps criss-crossed by pipelines and blighted by poverty and oil-fueled violence.

On a speedboat trip to the site of a clean-up operation launched by Shell last year, a makeshift oil refinery stood idle on a charred landing. The ground was soaked with oil, the air heavy with petrol fumes and slicks glistened in the water nearby. There were few signs of birds or fish.

So far this year, 85 crude spills have been recorded, already higher than the previous two years. In 2016, militant attacks pushed the volume of spills to more than 30,000 barrels, a high since 2011.

Oil theft from SPDC rose to around 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 - a loss of nearly $180 million for the year - from 6,000 bpd the year before.

Despite all the problems and costs, however, Nigerian onshore operations generate billions of dollars annually.

Shell does not break down profits by country, but a report on payments to governments that the company publishes annually showed it paid around $1.1 billion in royalties, taxes and fees to the Nigerian government in 2017.

That means Shell earned more than $4 billion from oil and gas production in Nigeria in 2017 - around 7 percent of its total global output.

A Shell spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ data analysis.

The Nigerian Petroleum Ministry declined to comment.

Shell has shown it can shut down if it is not making money. It stopped producing oil completely in Iraq last year after half a century in the country, although it retains substantial gas operations.

“It’s hard to think Shell would stay put onshore and weather all the problems if the assets didn’t offer decent returns,” said Aaron Sayne, a financial crime lawyer working at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI). “To some extent, the onshore must still be worth the trouble.”

THEFT AND SPILLS

Shell remains central to Nigeria’s economy and society. SPDC - operated by Shell with a 30 percent stake while the Nigerian National Petroleum Co has 55 percent, France’s Total has 10 percent and Italy’s Eni has 5 percent - is the country’s largest oil joint venture, employing thousands.

The Anglo-Dutch giant’s operations drew unwelcome attention in the early 1990s when residents of the Delta’s Ogoni region called for fairer distribution of oil wealth and compensation for spills. The government cracked down and in 1995 executed nine protest leaders, including prominent writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, prompting Shell to end production in the area forever.

It retained control of the Trans-Niger Pipeline, however, and nearly a quarter of a century later, little seems to have changed on the ground.

Slideshow ( 10 images )

In 2015 Shell accepted responsibility for operational faults that caused the 2008 spills that dumped tens of thousands of oil barrels into creeks around Bodo, and paid a settlement of 55 million pounds to villagers.

Dozens of spills since, including one by a barge carrying stolen oil that sunk in July, are frustrating remediation efforts, clean-up officials said.

“You clean it up, you walk away, somebody goes back there and does the same thing. It’s like going around in circles,” said Ogonnaya Iroakasi, Ogoni restoration project supervisor and an SPDC member.

Around 80 percent of the spills are a result of sabotage, Shell data shows.

Shell has taken a number of steps to improve the situation in the area, including training youth to start up businesses and funding local community patrols, campaigns to raise local awareness and even a local radio station.

But critics say it is not enough.

“I am not minimizing the challenge of re-pollution but Shell are not doing enough to solve it,” said Daniel Leader, the Bodo community’s lead UK lawyer. “The pipelines are not equipped with the most basic leak detection technology and Shell is simply not present on the ground in these communities.”

Local residents are frustrated as the slow process stops many from fishing, one of the main sources of income. Much of the anger is focused on Shell but Eni has also struggled to cope in recent years. Since starting to report data to authorities in 2014, the Italian company has recorded more spills than Shell, according to Amnesty International.

“Please, don’t give up on us ... I hope that you guys here can force Shell to do the right thing,” Michael Porobunu, chairman of Gokana council of chiefs, told the clean-up crew and reporters on his porch.

OFF THE COAST

SPDC has sold 10 of the 27 field licenses in the Delta it held in 2010, mostly to local companies. It has applied to renew the remaining licenses, which expire next year.

The divestments are a reminder of another cost of doing business in Nigeria - corruption. Shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of oil mining license 42 to local firm Neconde in 2011.

Offshore operations are an attractive alternative to the Delta in many ways. The Bonga field 120 km (75 miles) off the coast is one of Shell’s prized assets since starting up in 2005.

The giant tanker, with a drilling platform that pumps 225,000 barrels of oil and 210 million cubic feet of gas per day from a field one km below, won the company’s “asset of the year award” in 2016 for its safety and reliability.

Many risks remain. In 2016, the Trans-Forcados pipeline was shut down for months after militants detonated a bomb at its sub-sea section. Shell and Eni face bribery allegations in a Milan court over the 2011 purchase of an offshore license. Drilling offshore is also more expensive and technically complex.

Shell and its partners will decide next year on whether to develop a new offshore field, Bonga Southwest.

“Such an investment will reopen the window for the next wave of investment in deep water Nigeria,” Bayo Ojulari, managing director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, said in Lagos."
16,"The Government of Belize, through the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, has released comprehensive petroleum data for 2006. Via a press release, the Government reports that to date Belize Natural Energy, the only oil producing company in Belize and the first to declare a commercial find—has produced 811,199.40 barrels of oil. A small 5.6% portion has remained for the local market and the rest of it—715,872.29 barrels—have been exported to the world market.

While Government does not place a clear dollar value beside these figures, Amandala has calculated, based on the data provided, that total oil sales have amounted to roughly $94 million, including about two million dollars in local sales.

The press release from GOB goes on to summarize what Government has collected and will collect from the deal.

“As it relates to Government-generated petroleum revenues, these are collected in the form of royalties, production share, income tax and government working interest,” the release said.

To date, Government has collected US$2.1 million in royalties, which is calculated at 7.5% of gross production. It notes that payment for the fourth quarter of 2006 is excluded.

At the end of January, GOB should also expect another 1.5% of net production, called production share, and, following recent amendments in the Income Tax legislation, GOB is also entitled to a 40% tax on chargeable income, retroactive to January 1, 2006. Finally, GOB has a 10% working interest in BNE’s oil field.

GOB said that BNE has prepared BZ$1.4 million in income tax towards the amount that will become due on March 2007 for the 2006 year.

“Payment is to be worked out at the end of the financial year at which time payment is to be made,” said the GOB release.

Total received to date, based on the data the Ministry provided, is $5.6 million.

Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Hon. Said Musa, had said, when the tax amendment was being introduced to legislators, that the amendment would bring GOB’s returns to roughly 50% of what is earned from Belize crude. Currently, the meter stands at just under 6%."
17,"After Microsoft’s recent announcement that it will “double the number of Black and African American people” within its leadership ranks, the Department of Labor has notified the company that its pledge smacks of good old-fashioned racism. As a federal contractor, Microsoft cannot engage in racism of any kind. The Labor Department noted that the company’s announcement “appears to imply that employment action may be taken based on race.”

The department has made clear that this is illegal. Federal contractors are expressly prohibited from “discriminat[ing] against any employee or applicant for employment because of race.” Microsoft has until the end of the month to explain just exactly how it plans to “double the number of Black and African American people” in its employ.

Perhaps Microsoft can try to accomplish this scheme through subtraction. Chevron used the Wuhan virus confusion to pull just such a racist arrangement. In July, a widely distributed Reuters article explained, “Chevron Corp expects to reduce the dominance of white males in company management during cost-cutting this year, upping the share of senior level jobs held by women and ethnic minorities to 44%.” The article, titled “Chevron Diversity Ratio to Improve as Layoffs Progress,” could just as easily be titled “Chevron Uses Crisis to Fire White Men.”

As the American left, which includes most Fortune 500 company leaders, has become increasingly racist, it is exceedingly rare that anyone in authority calls them out for it. Here the Department of Labor is doing more than that by demanding that Microsoft show its work, if you will. Not only is the department calling out Microsoft’s potential racism, but it is asking the company to explain it.

If the Labor Department is inclined to look into other companies, its staff would likely be very busy rooting out similar racist practices. All across corporate America, there is a push to pack companies with affirmative action quotas.

The left has grown bored with applying these racist policies only to college and graduate school admissions. To the left’s thinking, that only provides a platform for more equal opportunity in future career success. Unsatisfied with the results of their decades-long higher education experiment, progressives are now demanding not just equality of opportunity, but equality of outcome.

Take the As You Sow shareholder activist collective, for example. For years, the leftist advocacy organization’s member groups have been filing shareholder resolutions demanding affirmative action for boardrooms and C-suites, and all manner of racist and sexist bean-counting measures — but they are not satisfied.

They recently launched the “Racial Justice Initiative” to “compel action” and “hold corporations accountable.” In an email announcing the plan, CEO Andrew Behar said they are going to gather “data from 1,000 of the nation’s biggest corporations. We’ll analyze it from multiple angles, use it to separate leaders from laggards, and make it public in a Scorecard. Then we’ll hold the laggards accountable. … There won’t be any wiggle room for corporations.” Behar, it bears noting, is an old white man.

If you don’t think a scorecard, shareholder proposals, and pressure from As You Sow will affect corporate America, you haven’t been paying much attention. There is a reason 18 major companies, including Microsoft, are directly funding Black Lives Matter even as BLM activists burn American cities to the ground.

Leftist shareholder proposals, most of which flow from As You Sow, received record support in 2018, broke that record in 2019, and have now reached an all-time high in 2020. These proposals bring about real cultural and societal change and are a major reason for the woke capitalism phenomenon.

The Department of Labor, however, is sending a clear signal that companies might well be breaking the law if they go along with such pressure campaigns to adopt racist hiring practices. Labor’s efforts to root out Microsoft’s racism problem should be applauded — and replicated."
18,"BRYAN, Texas — Just 15 miles south of Texas A&M University, on the southern edge of Brazos County, is Millican, Texas. Its current population is 241.

But 153 years ago, during the Reconstruction era following the end of the Civil War, Millican was the place to be in Brazos County.

""So in 1868, Millican would have been the big town in this area, because the end of the railroad pre Civil War was in Millican and a very large percentage of black free men and women were living there,"" said Amy Earhart, project coordinator of the Millican Race Massacre 1868 project and associate professor of english and affiliated faculty of Africana studies at Texas A&M University.

The large number of newly freed African-Americans who had the right to bear arms, combined with the loss of voting rights for white Texans, signaled a dramatic shift in power. In July of 1868, a shift toward equality for Blacks incited one of the largest “race riots” in Texas, known today as the Millican Massacre.

“We are not sure it went on for several days. We don't have firm numbers. Newspapers around the world reported from five to 300 people murder, they all make clear that no white people were killed or only black people,"" said Earhart. ""The newspapers are pretty consistent on that. I've also read a report by the Governor of Texas, former Gov. [Elisha] Pease, and he also reports the same thing that it was a massacre of black freeman.”

The Millican Massacre was reported worldwide in newspapers from Panama to Europe, and it’s that public record in print and oral histories from Brazos Valley families that have helped fill in holes to what happened in Millican 153 years ago.

“It’s something that is very uncomfortable to talk about and one of the reasons why it is important is you don’t ever want it to happen again,"" said Barry Davis of the Brazos Valley African American Museum. ""We don’t want violence. Violence is not something Dr. Martin Luther King was all about, he was about love, working together and we can respect each other. So, you don’t want it to happen again and that’s why you want to study it and you want to know about it.""

The Millican Massacre has for decades been the secret left out of Brazos Valley history. Earhart hopes a Texas Historical Maker will soon mark the location of the massacre as she continues her work on the Millican Project.

“We filed an application for Texas historical marker to commemorate George Brooks and those who were murdered, and we should hear final approval. We're hoping by February, we've done the wording. It's going through all the processes. We're just waiting on final like 'Yes, we like the wording, we're going to send it off to the foundry.' So I'm excited that there will be a marker that people will see and know about this important event because it's kind of been erased.”

Along with Earhart, Reggie Brown, a former Exxon diversity executive, and Toniesha Taylor, department chair and associate professor of communication at Texas Southern University, have both been vital in getting a historical marker placed in Millican.

19,"The National Tailor Union of Liberia is struggling to defend the alleged mismanagement of items and money donated to the Union by Chevron Liberia limited.An agreement was signed between the tailor union and Chevron Liberia followed by a training conducted through the sponsorship of Chevron in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.

The grant from Chevron was intended to facilitate the construction and rehabilitation of areas in two counties for an effective establishment and full operation of a texture industry. It has been months since the training ended in Grand Bassa County with reports emerging from the camp of the Tailor Union that the donation and grant have been given to the union in Monrovia for distribution between two counties that attended the training.

The Grand Bassa County tailor union has complained of neither getting any of the money donated nor designer machines. The Assistant Coordinator of the Grand Bassa County Tailor Union, Isaac Kono said they are disappointed in their colleagues in Monrovia for not providing Grand Bassa County’s share of the Chevron’s gesture to the two counties.

Kono in an interview yesterday did not mention the amount of money and materials. However, he said his union has engaged the Montserrado chapter to make available its share of the donation and grant, but according to him, the Union in Monrovia headed By LassanaDawon has failed.

“We did our follow up and noticed that the grant has been given and the machines were on ground, but when we went to the Tailor Union office on Lynch Street, we met the president, LassanaDawon who confirmed to us that the materials were here but Grand Bassa is not to benefit because the MOU was only signed between Chevron and the Montserrado Union and not Grand Bassa Union,” he explained.

The purpose of the training was to empower and improve skills of Liberian fashion designers. It targeted about 75 participants from Montserrado and Grand Bassa Counties respectively. It was agreed that after graduation, participants of the training would have benefited from Chevron Liberia Limited by the donation of designing machines and a grant to the two counties that attended the training session.

The Grand Bassa County branch of the Tailor Union demands its fair share of the donation from Chevron. “We the Grand Bassa branch received information that the items reached Liberia along with the grant at the union’s head office in Monrovia, the Monrovia branch did not mention any tailoring union in Grand Bassa,” Mr. Kono explained.

He noted that the Grand Bassa branch did a follow up and confirmed arrival of the items and grant but the county is yet to get its share of the donation. The President of the Liberia National Tailor Union LassanaDawon declined to comment on the allegation when he was contacted via mobile. Dawon however promised to provide documents and explanations about the Chevron’s assistance subsequently.

Many people are returning to normal, but the Houston Food Bank still needs help. This veteran is so thankful for their assistance, she wants to pay it forward one day

HOUSTON, Texas -- The Houston Food Bank is slated to open a second warehouse and distribution facility in 2025 at Ella Boulevard and Hwy. 249 in Houston. Chevron donated a 53-acre parcel of land valued at $10 million to make the project possible, officials announced in a June 15 news release.

""We were encouraged and excited by Chevron's initiative and interest in how this land could be a conduit for change rather than simply a retail pad site, how it could take on a new life to help fellow Texans and how it could take our partnership to the next level,"" said Amy Ragan, chief development officer for the Houston Food Bank, in the release. ""As we learned during the pandemic, food wasn't so much the issue as was space for sorting, storing and distributing it. Chevron saw the need and potential and wanted to be the spark.""

The video above is from a previous July 2021 report.

The organization has seen its highest levels of demand yet in the past few years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters and inflation. Officials said from March 2020 and March 2021, household food demand increased by 85%.

During this time, the Houston Food Bank took on additional temporary warehouse space to help meet local needs. The Chevron donation will allow the organization to expand its reach and serve more individuals and families.

Eimear Bonner serves as president of the Chevron Technical Center and as a board member for the Houston Food Bank. Bonner said Chevron is proud to play a part in the expansion to benefit the community.

""The Houston Food Bank is doing incredible work helping our community thrive and prosper,"" Bonner said in a statement. ""Today, with Chevron's donation of 53 acres of land, the food bank can accelerate plans to build its new distribution center helping to provide new services, recruit more volunteers and distribute food more equitably.""

21,"Can you tell an oil well from an electric car? Do you know which poses greater risk to our environment? If you answered yes to both questions, you might expect the leading companies in each field to be rated very differently against environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment criteria. You would be wrong.

It seems counterintuitive that fossil-fuel behemoth ExxonMobil and clean-energy storage pioneer Tesla could score almost the same for ESG on certain rating platforms, but they do. As if that were not confusing enough, Tesla has at times been ranked simultaneously both top and bottom of the auto category by competing ratings.

Such inconsistency is essentially an unintended consequence of the breadth of ESG; its inclusivity is a must for mainstreaming, but also thwarts any attempt at a one-size-fits-all approach. Does this lack of coherence mean the credibility of ESG is shot?

Using self-reported data for ESG ratings

Part of the problem is firms effectively conduct their own health check, says Olivia Sibony, chief executive of ethical investment platform SeedTribe. “The system is fundamentally flawed. By allowing companies to self-certify, they can hone in on one or two aspects that might look good on paper but don’t, for example, consider the end-to-end life cycle of a product or service,” she says.

That said, there are always workarounds to be found. Smart investors rarely rely on headline ratings, but look instead at the underlying data, argues Robert Blood, founder and managing director of global NGO-tracking and analysis consultancy SIGWATCH. “ESG is not fundamentally flawed, but more an art than a science,” he says. “The most effective way to assess a company uses the broadest range of inputs from the widest range of sources.”

This data, of course, comes in many forms: hard and soft, self-reported and independent, from audited and third-party verified figures for carbon emissions and ethical sourcing, via workforce diversity and executive pay ratios, to compliance with data protection codes and advertising standards on greenwashing.

ESG is an umbrella term for a combination of largely unrelated thematic issues

In this there can be no absolutes, says Leon Saunders Calvert, head of sustainable finance, Lipper and I&A Insights, at Refinitiv. “ESG is an umbrella term for a combination of largely unrelated thematic issues. Implying there is only one way to organise the relative importance of metrics across all these areas potentially negates the value of cognitive diversity to both a company’s impact on the world and the world’s impact on a company,” he says.

Nevertheless, the sense that it is hard to compare apples with apples is real, not merely anecdotal, says Jennifer Ockwell, partner and head of institutional fundraising at Triple Point. “A 2019 MIT paper found that in a dataset of five rating agencies, correlations between ESG scores on over 800 companies were on average 0.61. By comparison, credit ratings for corporate bonds across both Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings are correlated at 0.99,” she points out.

Coming up with a better rating system

So how can the market mend ESG? Well, as different ratings agencies each adopt their own approach and asset managers employ proprietary models, the onus falls on companies to try to keep everyone data happy.

The difficulty, however, lies not in providing all the answers, but anticipating all the questions, says Vanessa Havard-Williams, partner and global head of environment at law firm Linklaters. “An underlying need is for corporates to better understand what is required and how their information is assessed,” she says. “Until there is greater clarity on this, there is a risk of companies not presenting all the information the market increasingly wants.”

Standards organisations and professional bodies are undoubtedly working hard to try to provide some clarity for the market and their members. Lack of effort is not the issue.

The Investment Association, for instance, announced at the start of 2019 that it was to undertake an industry-wide consultation of its members on matters of sustainability and responsible investment. The result was a new framework launched last November to support a common language and clear product categorisation for asset managers and investors.

Furthermore, in terms of achieving greater cross-sector harmonisation, collaboration has recently been announced between the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Global Reporting Initiative. The European Union is also developing next-generation metrics and reviewing disclosure requirements.

All in all, regulators are playing a significant part in embedding ESG criteria better across financial markets, says Ockwell. “Since 2018, there have been over 170 ESG-related regulatory measures proposed globally, more than the previous six years combined,” she says. “Notably, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities will integrate sustainability risk into new rules and guidance, coming into force in 2021.”

Funding a more sustainable future

Promising as such activity might sound, however, a blizzard of acronyms and abbreviations, plus regional disparity, still seems like more noise, rather than better signal.

In addition, the clamour for clarity around ESG is only getting louder, as evidenced by the aggressive positioning assumed by BlackRock in July. The investment house announced it was placing a total of 244 companies on watch for unsatisfactory progress on climate issues. It had already flexed its voting-action muscles against 53 of them earlier in the year.

In terms of global policing, therefore, what ESG really demands is more of a United Nations approach to peacekeeping and impartiality, perhaps literally. Sibony says: “The UN Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, are the closest we have to a standard for ESG ratings. The 17 SDGs and 169 associated targets are by no means perfect, but they are the best blueprint available to achieve a more sustainable future.”

The next stage would be for the UN proactively to create a tool that enables input of company data, simply and affordably, in turn creating a ne0w market for professionally trained auditors.

This is no quick fix, more an aspiration. But, ultimately, what is responsible investment if not aspirational?"
22,"Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) +2.2% pre-market Friday after releasing Q3 adjusted earnings and revenues that easily topped Wall Street expectations, helped by high oil prices and skyrocketing natural gas prices, and raising its quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.91/share.

Q3 net income totaled a record $19.66B, or $4.68/share, jumping 10% from the previous quarter's $17.9B, which also set a profit record at the time.

Earnings were driven by record refining volumes, strict cost controls and higher natural gas prices, which offset lower crude prices and weaker industry refining margins, the company said.

Q3 revenues surged 52% Y/Y to $112.07B from $73.78B in the year-ago quarter.

Q3 production totaled 3.7M boe/day, including a quarterly record from the Permian Basin of nearly 560K boe/day; gross production from offshore Guyana rose to nearly 360K boe/day.

Gas realizations increased 22% on European supply concerns and efforts to build inventory ahead of winter, more than offsetting the impact of decreasing crude realizations, which were down 12% on modest supply increases.

Exxon (XOM) said it achieved the best-ever quarterly refining throughput in North America and highest globally since 2008.

Cash increased by $11.6B to reflect a cash balance of $30.5B at the end of the quarter, with free cash flow of $22B; debt-to-capital ratio is now 19%, just below the low end of the company's target range.

23,"African oil and gas assets have become hot property as the world hunts for profitable projects in jurisdictions that will allow extensive exploitation.

This has come at an opportune moment for governments keen for added tax revenue, who were facing a drop in investment as oil and gas majors like Shell (SHEL) and BP (BP.) shift focus to other regions and non-fossil fuel projects. At the same time, banks have pulled back from funding major new fields that have found financing even in recent years, like the Mozambique onshore gas fields and Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) offshore LNG project on the maritime border of Senegal and Mauritania.

But now the energy crisis has revved up interest in the continent’s existing assets and expansion options.

The president of Shell USA has hit out at gender bias she experienced during a hearing in Congress with male peers.

Gretchen Watkins took to social media saying the interactions revealed an “unconscious bias that all energy executives are male”.

Ms Watkins was giving evidence to a subcommittee on fuel and gasoline prices in the US last month in the House of Representatives.

On a panel of six, where she was the only women, several times she was greeted as “Mr Watkins”.

In a Linkedin post, Ms Watkins said: “Now, you may say it’s an honest mistake – after all, most of the committee members were in the room, and the witnesses were joining by video. Others may say, well…who cares?

“But I care. I was the only woman on a six-person panel of my industry peers and I’ve worked hard to reach this point in my career. As the leader of Shell USA, I was proud to represent its more than 12,000 employees and the #energy we provide to Americans and the world. So, in those ‘mister’ moments, I felt frustrated.”

She went on to say that she regretted not speaking up on the matter at the time, concerned that correcting a member of Congress could distract from the thrust of the meeting.

Ms Watkins said she thought about her daughters and female colleagues who have been called mister throughout their careers, “which can feel like a subtle suggestion that maybe you don’t entirely belong here”.

She was on the panel with peers from Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP, among others.

Ms Watkins added: “I should have said something because everyone deserves respect, and one of the ways we show respect is by correctly referring to someone in the way that acknowledges their gender.

“So, moving forward I am going to use my position and privilege to more purposefully stand up for those that cannot.”

She concluded: “So…members of the committee, respectfully, it’s Ms. Watkins.”

Just weeks after London’s Science Museum sparked angry protests, and the eventual resignation of a board member, for holding an exhibition on the climate crisis sponsored by oil company Shell, the museum has now agreed a sponsorship deal with major coal producer Adani.

The museum made the announcement of a new gallery sponsored by Adani as international investors gathered for a Global Investment Summit hosted at the museum by Boris Johnson, billed as an effort towards building “the green economy of the future”, ahead of the Cop26 climate summit.

The Adani sponsorship has been described as “astonishing” and “reckless” by conservationists.

The Indian company, whose activities include coal mining, oil refining and gas distribution, as well as renewable energy projects, is currently planning to build one of the largest coalmines in the world, in Australia, where there are concerns it could have a serious impact on the Great Barrier Reef.

The new “Energy Revolution” gallery is due to open in 2023, and will examine “how the world can undergo the fastest energy transition in history to curb climate change”, the museum said.

Culture Unstained, a campaign group that aims to end the sponsorship of cultural events by fossil fuel firms, said: “While declaring it wants to be the largest renewable energy company in the world by 2030, Adani is also expanding its coal footprint by 800 per cent.”

Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth told The Independent that accepting sponsorship from Adani was “unacceptable”.

“In the midst of a climate crisis, national institutions shouldn’t be part of the fossil fuel industry’s desperate attempts to greenwash its image.”

The alignment with a major coal producer comes immediately after 70 scientists called on the British government to immediately end all new investment in fossil fuels.

Coal remains the biggest contributor to the worsening climate crisis and the International Energy Agency has said new investment in coal, oil and gas must end this year in order to meet the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement.

The Science Museum is already under intense pressure to follow other London museums and art galleries and stop agreeing sponsorship deals with oil and gas firms.

It currently has deals with Shell, BP and Equinor, and has been accused of providing a platform for these firms for “greenwashing”.

On 2 October the museum’s former director Professor Chris Rapley resigned from its advisory board over its “willingness to accept oil and gas sponsorship”.

In a statement the Science Museum said: “The gallery will explore the latest climate science and the energy revolution needed to cut global dependence on fossil fuels and achieve the Paris targets to limit global warming to around 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.”

Dame Mary Archer, chair of the Science Museum Group, said: “We’re hugely grateful to Adani Green Energy for the significant financial support they are providing for this gallery.

“This gallery will take a truly global perspective on the world’s most urgent challenge. We face a grave threat, but the future is not predestined – it is still in our hands if we can build the coalition required for urgent and far-reaching action.”

Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Green Energy, said: “The Renewable Energy revolution to get to this point has been remarkable. The limitless power of the wind and sun is awe inspiring and our ability to harness that power is finally within reach.

“There is so much to learn from the history of this journey as the world writes a cleaner future and who better than the Science Museum team to depict this inspiration.”

In response to a request for comment from The Independent on the decision to partner with Adani, Sir Ian Blatchford, the director and chief executive of the Science Museum highlighted Adani’s renewable energy portfolio. The company is also expanding its parallel fossil fuel interests.

“Adani Green Energy is an example of an energy sector business bringing expertise and investment to renewables at scale,” he said.

“Adani Green Energy already has one of the world’s largest renewable portfolios and plans to invest $20bn in clean energy generation, component manufacturing, transmission and distribution over the next 10 years.

“And be in no doubt, such massive investments are needed to move India, a country of 1.38 billion people, from high carbon to low carbon energy whilst still meeting their growing energy needs. And that sustainable energy needs to reach the vast network of rural communities, as well as the cities.”"
28,"Less than two weeks after ExxonMobil’s CEO testified to Congress that the company “has long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change, and … has devoted significant resources to addressing those risks,″ a lobbyist for the company seemed to have undermined some of those claims.

Erik Oswald, a registered lobbyist and vice president for the company, said the climate crisis does not bring “catastrophic inevitable risk” and that the company does not see itself as part of “the climate fix.” The comments came during an event hosted by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in Santa Fe, N.M. The Washington Post obtained a recording of the panel from Documented, a watchdog group.

“Is it catastrophic inevitable risk? Not in my mind. But there is risk,” Oswald said.

“The way we think about this is not as the Crusaders who are the climate fix,” he added. “We’re looking at markets.”

Oswald had been asked by a fellow panelist why the U.S. should put subsidies into carbon capture — technology that captures carbon dioxide from sources like coal-fired power plants, either reusing or storing it to prevent greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere — while other nations are trying to curb emissions or turn to green technologies instead.

“It’s a strange deal for a scientist but people are willing to pay a green premium,” he said. “All around the world they are showing they’re willing to do that. Why they are doing that? That’s another question. There are lots of markets that, I mean people bought sugar-free, there’s all kinds of markets that are unhinged from hard facts.”

In an emailed statement to the Post, Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said the statements are not in the proper context. “The statements you provided lack appropriate context and are not representative of the company’s positions on important issues, including climate change and carbon capture,” Norton said.

“ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks,” Norton added. “In addition to our substantial investments in next generation technologies, ExxonMobil also advocates for responsible climate-related policies.”

At least one House Democrat wasn’t buying Exxon’s greenwashing at the congressional hearing in October. “They are obviously lying like the tobacco executives were,″ said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee. Maloney and her fellow Democrats have criticized Exxon because another secret recording caught one of its lobbyists bragging that the company used “shadow groups” to thwart climate science and lobbied senators to weaken Biden’s agenda on climate.

A 2017 report from the Climate Accountability Institute found that ExxonMobil accounts for nearly two percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions."
29,"SINGAPORE - A 49-year-old man was sentenced to four weeks' jail on Friday (Nov 27) for accepting $6,000 in bribes while he was working as the health, environment and safety specialist with Chevron Singapore at its lube oil blending plant.

Cheow Hock Mun was also ordered to pay a penalty sum of $6,000, in default of which he will have to serve 20 days' jail.

The permanent resident had earlier pleaded guilty on Oct 9 to two counts of receiving a bribe in return for being lenient in supervising work done by the sub-contractor, LGC Engineering and Contractors (LGC), at the plant.

Another similar charge was taken into consideration during sentencing by District Judge Edgar Foo.

Court documents state that Cheow was in charge of all safety and security matters at the plant, which is located in Jalan Buroh.

He also oversaw the issuing of permits and training of workers at the plant.

Cheow accepted the money from Lim Gim Chuan, the managing director of LGC, on three occasions between April and July 2015.

Lim was aware that Cheow was the overall in charge of safety at the plant, and that he had the authority to make things difficult by not approving the permits for his workers or by finding faults in their safety aspects.

This would eventually cause delays and financial losses for Lim's company.

Court documents said that some time in April 2015, Lim asked to meet Cheow at the canteen of the plant, where he offered Cheow $2,000 and, in Hokkien, asked for ""a helping hand"".

Cheow understood that Lim meant for him to ensure a ""smooth operation"" of his company's works at the oil plant. Cheow later took $2,000 from Lim.

Lim gave him a similar amount on two other occasions."

The ecological and social implications of climate change have – or should – become a central parameter for all discussions of work and capitalism. It is generally agreed that reliance on the burning of fossil fuels as the pre-eminent energy source for production and consumption over the history of capitalism is the critical factor in the ruinous greenhouse gas emissions triggering global warming, which would become irreversible if the earth’s atmosphere were brought to a ‘tipping-point’. The leading scientific estimates project that a rise in average global temperatures of 2°C (and now often just 1.5°C) is the threshold for irreversible climate change; that this can be expected from an accumulation of 1 trillion metric tonnes of carbon in the atmosphere; that we are approaching 600 million tonnes; and that the carbon ‘tipping-point’ may well be reached in 30 years unless carbon emissions can be reduced by 2-5% per year (and now often even more severe reductions).[1] The unrelenting build-up of greenhouse gases has led to the jarring conclusion, drawn by climatologists, ecological militants and union activists, that an exit from reliance on fossil fuels for energy needs to occur with some urgency.

In Canada, the hyper-development of the Alberta tar sands, as well as the intensifying exploitation of both conventional and unconventional fossil fuel deposits across the country, has opened a major political divide over climate change strategies and their implications for work.[2] On the one side, the oil industry, governments and many workers in the oil and gas sectors have sought to lock-in the further tar sands development. They have argued that this could be done through a strategy of carbon intensity (more output per unit of carbon emitted from fossil fuels burned) by ‘green growth’ and a range of ‘market ecology’ measures to shift consumer behaviour toward energy saving. On the other side, many Aboriginal nations and ecological and labour organizations have pushed for a transition to an ‘ecologically-sustainable’ economy built around ‘green’ technologies, a renewable energy regime and ‘green jobs’ that would ‘de-carbonize’ production processes. (For the Aboriginal nations, this also could involve reclamation, if on an entirely different foundation, of traditional territories and economies.) This could be accomplished, it is argued, through ‘Keynesian-style’ public policies that build non-market institutions that embed and guide capitalist markets along a more sustainable and equitable growth path – in effect an ‘institutional ecology’.[3]

For reasons of both theoretical clarity and the political injunction to address climate change, the varied strategies for ‘greening work’ need dissection. If the levels of carbon emissions are to be stabilized, it will be necessary to not be limited by plans acceptable to the capitalist classes and their interest in endless accumulation. An ambitious vision of possible eco-socialist alternatives for Canada needs, we argue, to connect the restructuring of work to wider transformations in the socio-ecological system. This is a key task of the growing movement, in Canada and globally, to stop the tar sands and stand for climate justice.

Work and Capitalism

“To make earth an object of huckstering – the earth which is our one and all, the first condition of our existence – was the last step toward making oneself an object of huckstering.”[4]

— Friedrich Engels

The current societal addiction to fossil fuels is intimately tied to the dynamics of capitalist production and the exploitative nature of work. Although it is true that humans have always had to labour, and through this interact with and transform nature in order to re-produce themselves as social, cultural, and natural beings, these interactions take on particular characteristics in capitalist society. What, then, are these characteristics? Historically, the loss of direct access to nature – in particular, land – as a means for producers to gain their subsistence for reproducing their households has had important consequences for labour and social life. Understanding some of these peculiar dynamics of capitalism will help us evaluate the possibilities and limits of green work.

Capitalist social relations are characterised by a general situation in which the producing class is stripped of all non-market means of reproduction. That is, workers are market dependent and must sell their labour-power to a capitalist for a wage, with the earnings then used to buy the necessities of life now sold as commodities in the market. Labouring has become the forced commodified labour – or work – of capitalist societies. In turn, capitalists appropriate all of the products and the value realized from the sale of commodities, including any surplus they can earn in the form of profits after their costs are met.

Here, the market mediates the collective interaction and metabolism with nature that occurs with capitalist production. For each individual capitalist, the primary goal of investment and production is to realise profits, rather than satisfying human needs consistent with ecological sustainability. In this sense, both workers and nature are brought into the production process simply as inputs, as a means to another’s end.[5] In this process, workers lose control over the products of their labour, the labour process itself, and the interaction with nature that this entails. In short, work within capitalism is, at its core, an experience of exploitation and alienation. As the social surplus that results from production is owned privately, decisions on the direction of investment (say, to move from fossil fuels to solar power) also lie in private hands rather than involving workers affected or being democratically decided.

The intrinsic character of capitalism means ‘competitive imperatives’ compel capitalist firms to constantly attempt to lower the costs of production to earn the profits necessary for the accumulation of capital that ensures their survival. To do so and increase the value they appropriate, firms try to increase the length and intensity of the workday, lowering wages, and increasing the productivity of labour through technological development. The last implies using less labour for the same or more output. To maintain or even increase employment with technological advancement, then, the market must grow (or, for an individual firm, at least its market share increase).[6] Fossil fuels have been decisive: they have been the key energy enabler of the machinery necessary for the continual 24/7 production and consumption cycles characteristic of capitalism. Indeed, it is in this fusion that the particular ‘space-time’ dynamic of capitalist production consolidates in the unremitting effort to unhinge accumulation from nature and the constraints of material time and space, in the pursuit of abstract exchange-value in the form of money.[7]

Similarly, demands for better wages, working conditions, or environmental quality all increase the costs of production. Within capitalist social relations, these demands can only be met through lowering profits or – wait for it – more technological change and growth. What we see, then, is that the pursuit of growth becomes the preferred way of mediating social and distributional conflicts necessarily engendered in capitalist production without also changing its underlying social property relationships. This apparent solution, however, raises further contradictions. The unrelenting quest for economic growth causes the unsustainable deployment of fossil fuels leading to climate change, degradation of wildlife habitats, mountains of waste and a host of other socio-ecological issues. In this sense, capitalist growth displaces the conflicts over work and income through time into nature via the buildup of ecological crises and into space in the form of the unequal relations between states and peoples in the world market.

It is this context of the capitalist growth imperative, with all of its social and ecological impacts, that proposals for ‘green growth’ through policies of ‘market ecology’, and for ‘green jobs’ by an ‘institutional ecology’, can best be understood. Each has stood for an alternate path – within capitalism – out of both the climate crisis and the economic stagnation that has gripped the world market since 2008.

Green Growth and Market Ecology

Some may be surprised to see how the economic crisis has re-invigorated neoliberal politics (of freer markets to increase the profits and power of capital) in the form of a strategy of ‘permanent austerity’ imposed on the public sector and workers. An agenda of ‘green growth’ to address climate change, best laid out in the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Towards a Green Economy, and the United Nations (UN) report for the 2012 Rio+20 summit, Working Towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy,[8] has emerged as a core feature of neoliberal renewal.

The environmental crisis, the reports contend, is fundamentally a problem of a “gross misallocation of capital.”[9] The full suite of neoliberal proposals, now with a ‘market ecology’ twist, are offered: removal of subsidies in agriculture; privatization of public utilities to impose market discipline and prices; public-private partnerships with full-cost recovery in the guise of ‘polluter pays’ pricing; leveraging ‘green’ private investment to rebuild with carbon-reducing public infrastructure; promotion of free trade and intellectual property rights to encourage trade and growth in ‘green’ products and technology transfer; to name but a few. Remarkably, in light of the financial crisis, they propose to encourage more financialization: that is, the predominance of financial markets in driving carbon reduction investments through the development of ‘green’ financial instruments. For instance, the insurance industry, given its experience with managing risks in general, is now touted as the best driver of the ‘green economy’, given its capacity to ‘price in’ environmental risks. This will encourage, so the market logic goes, preventative measures and shift relative prices favourably toward ‘green’ production.

In a striking example of market fetishism, more prices and more markets are proposed. Nature and pollution are put forward as new zones of accumulation, with the state facilitating the creation of markets and property rights where none existed before. With more complete and transparent markets, capitalist growth will be ‘greener,’ and an energy transition from fossil fuels toward renewables will ‘naturally’ occur via firm responses to more efficient price signals. ‘Green jobs’ follow in due course. The market imperatives that drive capital accumulation and carbon emissions are now offered up, without any sense of paradox or doubt, as the solution to the climate crisis.

‘Green Jobs’ and Institutional Ecology

The long-standing failure of ‘protecting the environment through privatizing it’ has led many environmental and labour organizations to take a different tack. Instead, they have focused on ‘green jobs’ resulting from a ‘green’ restructuring of the capital stock (not the ownership or control of industry) and a change in government policies (not a democratization of the state). The landmark UN report, Green Jobs: Towards Decent Work in a Sustainable, Low-Carbon World defines ‘green jobs’ as “work in agricultural, manufacturing, research and development (R&D), administrative, and service activities that contribute substantially to preserving or restoring environmental quality.”[10] The criteria of being a ‘decent’ job also need to be met to be considered a ‘green job’. Like other such reports, Green Jobs urges a mix of stronger public investment and regulation with market-based policy instruments: carbon markets; payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes; eco-taxes; and redirection of incentives and subsidies from ‘dirty’ to ‘green’ industries.

Since the economic crisis, this ‘institutional ecology’ project is associated with the idea of a ‘Green New Deal,’ as part of a Keynesian stimulus package to tackle economic stagnation.[11] Government stimulus funds, for example, could be mobilized to build the infrastructure for a transition to renewable – solar, wind, biofuels – energy and other ‘green’ sectors rather than further lock-in a high-carbon infrastructure. The Green New Deal also commonly includes: support for research and development into energy and resource efficient technologies; upgrading public infrastructure and building ‘smart grids’; retrofitting buildings; and expanding public transportation. Such ‘green’ sectors, moreover, will tend to be relatively labour-intensive and thus create more jobs than investment in ‘traditional’ sectors. The basic idea is encouraging ‘green jobs’ via ‘green growth’ (as with the ‘market ecology’ project of the neoliberals) as a central means of transitioning to a low carbon economy.

These policies certainly modify some of the most ecologically abusive features of capitalist production. For the most part, they merit support for at least ‘doing something’. But there are also serious limitations. Note, for example, that according to the UNEP definition oil spills from pipelines carrying diluted bitumen (or ‘dilbit’) from the tar sands could lead to a rise in ‘green jobs’ because employment in environmental remediation counts as ‘green’ employment. The quantitative growth in ‘green jobs’ may not be a proxy for anything more than coping with the ecological consequences of capitalist production – the so-called ‘shades of green’ jobs problem – and the inability to actually address climate change,

Although the Green Jobs report argues that investment in ‘green’ sectors would lead to a net gain in employment, a low-carbon economy would adversely impact employment in industries such as oil and gas extraction. Workers displaced by climate change mitigation policies would thus require the support of ‘active labour market policies’, such as skills re-training, education upgrades, temporary income support, and the like. Such a ‘just transition’ would help workers in carbon-based industries to gain employment in emerging ‘green’ sectors. A number of the ‘green jobs’ reports also suggest that revenues from imposing various eco-taxes might be used to reduce payroll taxes (such as the employer contribution to social security) in order to boost employment. This would produce, they suggest, a ‘double dividend’ of achieving both employment and environmental gains.[12]

It is clearly suspect for a ‘just transition’ to cut taxes on employers and then fund income support out of ‘pollution’, and to adhere to neoliberal fallacies that unemployment is a result of the high cost of labour (and thus workers can be ‘priced’ back into employment). Indeed, the initial Green Jobs report even took up the concept of ‘flexicurity’, implicitly accepting the neoliberal push for labour flexibility with its intent on increasing the precariousness of work and weakening unions.

To add to the confusion of the meaning of ‘green jobs’, there is often a recognition in these reports that a significant portion of the jobs found within ‘green’ sectors are informal, non-unionized jobs with poor working conditions. They cannot meet the test of decent work. This is particularly true of the recycling industry in the Global South: for instance, the informal work of wastepickers or electronics recycling in China. A recent World Bank report circumvents the issue by simply arguing that the requirement of decent work should not be applied to the developing world when planning for ‘green jobs’, as even near subsistence wages might contribute to ‘poverty reduction’.[13] The ILO, in contrast, tends to consider how low wages and poor working conditions are actually what constitute the poverty of these workers. They call for the formalization of these ‘green’ sectors so as to improve working conditions and transform these into decent jobs.[14] Similar problems are, in fact, common to ‘green jobs’ in core capitalist zones.

In any case, efforts to improve workers’ rights, wages, and ecological sustainability run up against the competitive imperatives to lower the costs of production. Without substantial long-term extra-market institutional (or state) coordination, it is quite unclear what can be achieved beyond stimulating initial modest investments in renewable energy and adjustments in regulatory rules. This has been the case even in something as basic as the informal recycling sector. If the transition to decent and ‘green jobs’ cannot be achieved through market mechanisms, then the entire ‘institutional ecology’ project of leveraging the private sector for an exit from the climate crisis will fail. Even with a fundamental break with austerity-friendly fiscal policies and new eco-taxes, substantial collective investments and non-market interventions would be necessary to generate and maintain decent ‘green jobs’.

In this sense, the ‘institutional ecology’ path to ‘green jobs’ shares a great deal with the ‘market ecology’ agenda in depending upon capitalist sector led growth. If the ‘only’ problem is environmental impact, so the logic of both goes, then it is possible to continue to encourage growth as long as the ecological footprint is reduced. And capital accumulation can be ‘decoupled’ from more intensive resource use through more efficient markets and technological improvement, including the burning of fossil fuels. Yet more growth within capitalism has consistently resulted in greater aggregate resource use and carbon emissions, even when relative gains in resource and energy efficiency are achieved.[15] And even the most optimistic scenarios raise serious doubts that, in a long phase of stagnation, continued capitalist growth can be consistent with greenhouse gas reductions. In short, these are technical ‘solutions’ to a broader social problem. These ‘solutions’ to climate change are, to be sure, also political strategies defending particular interests.[16]

Carbon Reduction and Environmental Justice Alternatives

The energy sector poses, in the starkest terms, the limits of the ‘green economy’ within capitalism. Rather than lead a transition toward renewable energy as ‘price signals’ register peak oil, the market has increased supply in ‘extreme energy’, with a systemic market failure to register carbon emission constraints. Indeed, the International Energy Agency now refers to a new ‘golden age of gas’ as reported fossil fuel supplies swell.[17] Under current usage patterns, even by 2040 up to 75% of all energy could still be supplied by fossil fuels,[18] provided that the industry overcomes obstacles such as finite fresh water supplies. Canadian oil and gas companies would, of course, be central contributors to supply. At some 173 billion barrels of recoverable oil (and ultimate potential of 343 billion barrels), the Alberta tar sands are generally considered to be the second largest deposit in the world.[19] With conventional oil production in decline, tar sands bitumen now constitutes more than half of production and will continue to increase (and, of course, serves as the single largest source of carbon emissions in Canada). In other words, the projected burning of these reserves for energy would easily breach the 2°C global warming distress threshold which many organizations have highlighted.

The massive capital investment in fossil fuel extraction, further intensified with extreme energy, means that employment in these operations is slight – the lowest of any sector in Canada – relative to output and emissions. Estimates for global employment in the sector are only at about 10 million worldwide. In Canada, employment is about 120,000 including fossil fuel extraction, coal and petroleum manufacturing products and support activities, or well less than 1% of total employment, with tar sands employment assessed at around 20,000 jobs (with totals expected to increase with new developments).[20] The numbers employed directly in extraction are even less: a large portion of employment occurs in planning and development, construction and servicing sites. If many of these jobs are well-paid, they are also surprisingly precarious and insecure as projects and output volumes wind up and down; and they have come to include a ‘second-tier’ of migrant workers with limited rights. The shift to renewables is likely, in almost all forecasts, to have a positive impact on employment during both construction and steady-state operations due to the lower capital-intensity. But this should not be exaggerated (as renewables producers do), as this is still quite capital-intensive production. A shift to renewable energy is neither a solution to the general problem of unemployment in capitalism, nor of the employment instability from climate change.

The political imaginary of a climate justice movement cannot be confined, therefore, to a market-led energy transition, either spurred by further institutional coordination or not. It can become a vital example of societal political alliances co-joining in programmatic alternatives. At the scale of the workplace, this struggle has formed around the notion of a just transition. As noted above, this is set narrowly as retraining policies for workers as fossil fuel extraction is phased-down and workers shift to indeterminate prospects elsewhere in the economy. Workers and communities adjust as the capitalist classes shift to value extraction in new ‘green’ sectors. A more ambitious just transition would extend workers’ collective rights and point toward new socio-ecological relations.[21] That is, a militant rejection of the quantitative commodification of nature and life, for a transition to qualitative growth in de-carbonized and de-commodified sectors of production and work.

Such an ‘eco-imaginary’ is a rupture with the chase after ‘green jobs’ in a thoroughly commodified society. It could inform specific interventions at the scale of workplaces and building workers’ collective capacities:

incorporation of carbon reduction strategies within collective agreements through clauses on reductions of the carbon footprint, energy committees, and adjustment plans for jobs impacted by climate change.

workers’ plans forged to extend best-practices for carbon reduction in labour processes and between workplaces.

building democratic planning capacities for plant conversion to sustain capital equipment, workers’ skills and community infrastructure as ecologically-responsible production norms are internalized.

participatory planning structures built at the level of local wards for carbon reduction and ecological clean-up in neighbourhoods.

An energy transition extends beyond particular labour processes, and the fossil fuel branches of production, to the energy sector as a whole.[22] In providing the general conditions facilitating production and consumption, the energy sector tends to be both highly concentrated and monopolistic, as well as highly decentralized and diversified. An

energy transition entails concerns not only with the phasing out of fossil fuel production (and immediate limits on extreme energy such as the tar sands) and the reversal of neoliberal privatization of power supplies. It also needs to be conceived in terms of ‘energy democracy’: public ownership and control; diversity, decentralization and localization in production and control; and transparency and accountability in ecological impacts.[23] For the most part, renewable energy production also fails miserably on all these accounts.

Here energy conservation and renewable technological conversion need to link to ‘structural reforms’ that push beyond capital:

democratization and participatory planning over centralized energy production and supply systems.

reduction in the massive capital intensity involved in fossil fuel and nuclear production to give developmental preference to a diversity of direct and local production.

redistributive energy supply and pricing strategies.

publicly-supported technological transfer to equalize renewable energy access globally.

If it is quite wrong to expect climate change to be resolved by more markets and more technology, it also cannot be limited to an energy transition. Some have recognized and challenged these limitations, however. In its response to climate change, the International Transport Workers’ Federation put out a remarkable statement advising that “there is no alternative but to progressively liberate key sectors of economic life from the imperatives of profit and consumption … [and to expand] social and democratic ownership of industries that produce emissions … to prevent further damage to people and the environment and to plan an equitable and orderly transition to a low carbon economy.”[24] This ecological directive is consistent with the long-standing socialist case for de-commodified production in an egalitarian world order. The core left programme is also strikingly carbon-reducing in its implications:

a sharp reduction in standard worktime to share-out work and increase the time for democracy and self-management of workplaces.

a shift from private to public transit in electrified systems tied to ‘transit justice’ and ‘free fares’.

the extension of de-commodified public spaces in terms of parks, museums and galleries, and cultural and recreational spaces.

the mass public expansion of the caring sectors.

universalization of free post-secondary education for all age groups.

dismantling of military production and mobilization of civil brigades for ecological restoration.

These demands could easily be extended.[25] They should be at the centre of any ecological justice movement. In practical outline, they present a possible future directly connecting a de-carbonized energy regime to quality-intensive, democratized work, and from there to the provisions of everyday life as social need. They are essential to overcoming the claims of the neoliberal period has had on our political imaginary, even in activist circles, and the claptrap of carbon markets and ‘greening growth’.

Beyond Green Jobs

An alternate agenda for the democratization of work, and over the production and supply of energy, is ecologically necessary and economically feasible. Significant political hurdles exist, however.

The fossil fuels energy regime has been integral, we have argued, to capitalist development and is embedded in the entire economic structure, from energy to transportation to plastics to agro-industry and all else. In Canada, the entire spectrum of energy corporations are a central component of the power structure, with the financial industry intricately linked to the financing, insurance and speculative interests of the oil and gas sector. The Canadian state has, moreover, had a central strategic objective for over three decades of turning Canada into the pre-eminent 21st century energy superpower, steadily building the Canadian accumulation regime around this prospect. This strategy entails running down conventional oil and gas resources, and increasing the exploitation of ‘extreme energy’ via drilling in the Arctic and deep seas, fracking for shale gas, ‘tight oil’ recovery and, of course, the mass mining of the tar sands. As a result, climate change policies in Canada have been all but completely absent. Alternate decentralized energy development, on the one hand, and democratically controlled public power provision, on the other, have been wholly lacking in coordinated state support.

Divestment from fossil fuels is a necessary condition for stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus a core demand of the climate justice movement. It is politically inconceivable to isolate a transition out of fossil fuels from a project of democratizing the state and a vision of a post-capitalist society. The ecological crisis is deeply intertwined with the modes of energy usage internal to the production and consumption patterns of contemporary capitalism – endless accumulation, overconsumption alongside hideous inequalities, the environment served up as a dumping ground for industrial waste, the ceaseless commodification of agriculture spaces and wetlands. The massive destruction of the

boreal forest for the toxic mines of the Alberta tar sands is only the most visible and violent landscape produced by this mode of development.

Anti-fossil fuel campaigns, however, too often remain confined within the market logic of the ‘green economy,’ trading-off a measure of ecological re-mediation for more capital accumulation. Any number of the market-based policies to address global warming commit this folly – through carbon emissions trading, feed-in-tariffs, conversion tax incentives, and so forth. The notion of shifting ‘brown work’ into ‘green jobs’ suffers from the equally crippling illusion that climate change might be technocratically managed by supplementing market pricing with a few ‘green’ institutional supports, without any rupture in the existing matrix of political institutions and social forces. These ideological confusions about markets and technological fixes too often provide cover for further tar sands development, as deftly utilized in the propaganda bombardment from the Canadian oil and gas industry.

It is ‘capitalism as a system’ that is the central obstacle in the transition to ecologically responsible production, work and energy regime.[26] Marx pointed out in the Grundrisse that capitalism has a general disdain for nature apart from the use-values it can appropriate (and the accumulation regime in Canada particularly commits this sin). And this contempt extends to workers apart from the value their labour produces. “For the first time, nature becomes purely an object for humankind, purely a matter of utility… whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production.”[27] This arises not from whim or malice on the part of individual capitalists, even if overt scheming and greed has always characterized the oil industry. It emerges from the competitive imperatives to maximize profits and thus continually to annihilate space (as both natural and built environments) by the acceleration of time through productivity enhancement (enabled by the energy from fossil fuels).[28] The accumulation of capital is, historically and to this day, the accumulation of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere.

In the urgency to tackle climate change and to halt the extraction of the most destructive fossil fuel source on the planet, there is a normal inclination to take the detour of ‘market ecology’ and ‘green work’ in the hope of preventing further damage. But the political calculation of ecologists, unionists, and socialists needs to be as ambitious as the challenges at hand are large. This is to insist that a rupture with the existing paradigm of production and work is needed – ‘ways of living’ as the early ecology and socialist movements envisioned. Solar communism, anyone?[29] •"
31,"Guillaume asked herself before the first meeting of the divestment working group: “How am I going to make them listen to me, this student?” Mathias Gjesdal-Hammer

When the divestment working group released its final report in May, 200 Cambridge academics signed an open letter calling it an attempt to thwart divestment.

On Wednesday, news broke that working group members Professor Simon Redfern and John Shakeshaft were directly involved in donations worth £22m from BHP Billiton and BP to fund research in Cambridge. The donation from BHP Billiton was later rescinded.

Alice Guillaume, who served on the working group for 11 months before she resigned in protest, has detailed the group’s inner workings for the first time. She said divestment was never really on the table—and it could be traced to power asymmetries in the room.

The working group was made up of ten people: two college masters, four academics, two members of the University’s primary decision-making body, one other student representative, then Guillaume, an undergraduate geography student and the most pro-divestment voice in the room.

Before her first meeting with the group, she had asked herself: “How am I going to make them listen to me, this student?”

When the group convened, Guillaume sensed some people’s opinions being considered more important than others. She remembered trying to bring up Royal Dutch Shell’s human rights violations as a consideration, and being dismissed.

In her time on the group, Guillaume perceived that financial knowledge was seen as superior, and knowledge of ethical considerations was seen as “fluffy”. She recounts another member trying to raise a point about ethics, then trying to qualify it, calling them “soft issues.”

It struck Guillaume then that others in the group too felt uncertain of themselves when trying to broach social issues – that there was a clear double standard in how seriously members treated financial considerations, while brushing off ethical ones. She suggested that the members of he working group were very well-versed in the financial implications of divestment, “but there are other forms of knowledge that are equally vital.”

Academics called into question aspects of the report emphasising financial knowledge in their open letter. At one point, it quoted an asset manager to CEOs who “emphasis[ed] the responsibility of businesses to ensure a good and responsibly managed return for investors”. Academics wrote: “we contest the relevance of this financial language to the Universities sector, which has no CEOs and offers no returns for investors.

“[We] have different ways of thinking about the world, of viewing the issues that matter, and you can see it reflected in how people approach an issue.” Problems began, Guillaume claimed, with who was chosen to serve on the working group.

The two ‘academics in relevant fields’ chosen were Professor Simon Redfern and Dr Jerome Neufeld.

“It’s just such a massive thing that was conveniently not mentioned at any moment”

“There are so many ways to understand academics working on relevant topics. To have two individuals from the earth sciences department seemed a bit suspect to me,” Guillaume said. She asked, what about people looking at the economics of climate change, or its social and political implications?

Then, at other points, “it struck me that [we weren’t] probing in the way I felt we should have been”, Guillaume said. She recalled that in evidence sessions with representatives from fossil fuels companies, she noticed some leading questions being asked.

At the mention of the working group’s recommendation of the creation of a centre for a carbon-neutral future , which would “combine research on energy production and use, climate, sustainability, and policy”, Guillaume scoffed. “A lot of the report is completely irrelevant to the issue of divestment.”

And in academics’ open letter, they wrote: “We believe that the creation of a talking shop of this kind … is no substitute for direct and decisive action in the present.”

Their point can be traced in large part to decisions made about who the group chose to hear evidence from. She remembers sitting in sessions with experts on carbon neutrality, feeling that they were a waste of time — that, though their work was important, it was irrelevant to the question of whether Cambridge should divest. “It was time that was taken away from actually thinking critically about the issue of divestment on to other issues, and this was right from the start.”

Students called for the University to divest in several mass rallies prior to Council's decision in June Louis Ashworth

“There were [other] times when I just had to say, wait you’re not understanding what divestment is”.

So she resigned.

After she resigned, Guillaume wrote in a Varsity article in March: “For almost a year I have been representing Cambridge Zero Carbon on the University’s divestment working group. Today, I am resigning from the group on the grounds that the report fails to address the urgency of climate change and the injustices it engenders.”

It wasn’t just about the report, but the entire process she witnessed leading up to the working group’s final recommendations. “The whole process was flawed. It was flawed from the beginning.”

Explained The 2018 divestment working group report The contents of the divestment working group report divided members of the University Council in May, in its recommendations that: 1. The University adopt a commitment to “considered divestment” 2. The University should commit to being carbon neutral by 2040 3. 100% of the University’s energy should come from renewable sources by 2030 4. The University should not invest in thermal coal or tar sands directly or indirectly 5. “10% of indirect investment should be placed with funds that embrace Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds that are “consistent with a carbon neutral future” 6. The University should commit to the UN Principles of Responsible Investment 7. The Investment Office should become increasingly transparent about its investment processes through an annual report, with “information on environmental and social funds”, as well as an “informative website” 8. The University should join the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), “or an alternative equivalent”, “to ensure it lends its voice and authority in engagement with industry” 9. A centre for a carbon-neutral future should be established to combine research on energy production and use, climate, sustainability, and policy Click to show

Following revelations published Wednesday on Redfern and Shakeshaft’s involvement in proposed donations from BP and BHP Billiton, a petition has been signed by over 1,000 people calling for the report to be “revoked”, and says that the legitimacy of the Council’s divestment decision has been “undermined”. For Guillaume, there wasn’t much to begin with. “It’s more about a lesson in the way in which vested interests do impact the way that the university operates.”

All working group members were asked to declare any conflicts of interest to the public, though it wasn’t a formal requirement.

Redfern’s sole disclosed conflict of interest was: “Wife is Editor of “Green Christian” (a journal of an organisation that is linked to advocacy of divestment).”

Shakeshaft declared that he chairs a “private investment fund (Valiance Co Investment) that has an undisclosed small residual interest in Celadon Mining, a Chinese coal mining company. The interest is illiquid, unsaleable and de minimis to the fund.”

Neither Shakeshaft nor Redfern responded to Varsity’s requests for comment.

Commenting on their role overseeing the donations from BHP Billiton and BP, Guillaume said: “It’s just such a massive thing that was conveniently not mentioned at any moment.”

There were moments she was more hopeful that divestment was possible. Then the group would convene again, and an evidence session or discussion would seem to her to tip things back in favour of the status quo.

She got the sense that for some members of the group, the University should “carry on business as usual, leave the Investment Office to what they do best, [that] how dare you try and interfere.”

In September, four months after the working group’s final report was released, nearly half of Cambridge’s investment office resigned, leaving its future uncertain.

“It’s a really important moment for scrutiny.”"

Yesterday, the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon for the third time and upheld a record $14.25 million civil penalty in one of the longest-running environmental enforcement suits ever brought under the federal Clean Air Act. The panel reaffirmed the district court’s findings that environmental group plaintiffs Sierra Club and Environment Texas had legal standing to sue Exxon for thousands of violations in which the company illegally released dangerous pollutants over a period of eight years at its Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and chemical plant complex and reaffirmed that Exxon must pay this penalty to the U.S. treasury to deter ongoing and future clean air violations.

Sierra Club and Environment Texas, represented by attorneys at the nonprofit National Environmental Law Center, sued Exxon on behalf of their members who are residents living near the Baytown complex where Exxon illegally released millions of pounds of sulfur dioxide, ozone-forming chemicals and toxic and carcinogenic pollutants into surrounding neighborhoods. On appeal, Earthjustice filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of a local environmental group, Air Alliance Houston, in concert with the University of Texas School of Law Environmental Clinic. The City of Houston and Harris County Attorney Office joined this amicus brief.

“This decision reaffirms that community members can hold polluters accountable and stand up for their fundamental right to clean air in court. No petrochemical company should be able to delay justice for over a decade while continuing to pollute the air. It's time to put this matter to rest, because Gulf communities need protection now more than ever from the harm caused by the oil industry,” said Mary Rock, attorney for Earthjustice.

“People across the Houston area have been exposed to toxic chemicals from polluters like Exxon for far too long because Texas' regulatory agencies literally allow them to operate this way. In Texas, it can cost less to be caught polluting than to continue to pollute. We cannot accept this. Today's decision makes it clear that the courts won't accept it either,” said Jennifer Hadayia, executive director of Air Alliance Houston.

“Exxon violated its air permits thousands of times and emitted illegal air pollution for years. This decision rightfully recognizes that Exxon’s illegal pollution had real impacts on the lives of the surrounding community and that Exxon should be held accountable for its violations,” said Kelly Haragan, director of the University of Texas School of Law Environmental Clinic.

The Clean Air Act is designed to protect public health, especially in places like the Houston area that have unsafe levels of pollution. The law’s enforcement provision recognizes that people exposed to and hurt by pollution have the greatest interest in making sure clean air protections are enforced to protect their health and safety, and gives them the right to bring suit to complement governmental enforcement."
33,"Jeremy Musson looks at the exemplary revival of Elton House and its outstanding collections on the eve of its handover to the next generation, while John Goodall looks at the history and changing face of the buildings from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. Photographs by Will Pryce for Country Life.

Jeremy Musson on the exemplary revival of Elton House

Elton Hall, near Peterborough, is a house of many faces. It is formal and Classical on the approach, yet reveals on inspection a complex architectural history stretching back to the Middle Ages. All this with gardens that extend and frame it with a kind of painterly stillness. Inside, the house has one of the best private art collections in the East of England.

Country Life last visited Elton in 1988, when an article by Gervase Jackson-Stops campaigned against a proposed new road. Before that, in 1957, were three fulsome pieces by Arthur Oswald, which ignored the division of half the house into flats. Since 1980, Sir William and Lady Proby have not only reversed that subdivision and restored the complex roof and stonework, but also laid out new gardens, rehung pictures and redecorated the principal apartments. This year, they will hand over to their eldest daughter Alexandra — together with her husband, Rory Aitken, and their children — and retire to a new house on the estate. What better moment to celebrate and record their achievement?

There is also a wider story to tell here. The estate, house and collections, as well as opening to the public, have all provided valuable experience for Sir William and Lady Proby too, which they have readily applied over decades to the public realm. Sir William served as president of the Historic Houses Association in 1994–99 and as chairman of the National Trust in 2003–08; he was also chairman of the National Portrait Gallery from 2011 to 2017. Lady Proby is a Syndic of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, chair of its Development Trust and a member of the Government’s Acceptance in Lieu panel.

As it survives today, the house bears the stamp of important changes undertaken from 1857 by Granville Proby, the 3rd Earl of Carysfort, which is remarkable, given that he was 74 when he inherited the estate in 1855. He had grown up on the family’s Glenart estates in Co Wicklow, Ireland, fought at the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar asa naval officer and later rose to the rank of Admiral. What inspired him to undertake this work is not now clear, but it may have been the poor condition of the building.

The architect he chose was Henry Ashton, a pupil of Smirke who served as an assistant to Sir Jeffry Wyatville from 1828 during the latter’s transformation of Windsor Castle (and who edited Wyatville’s posthumously published Illustrations Of Windsor Castle, 1841). It must have been through Windsor that Ashton caught the eye of the anglophile Willem II (Prince of Orange until 1840), who commissioned him, in 1838, to design a summer palace at the Hague. Nothing came of the project.

Otherwise, Ashton is an exiguous figure. His obituary in The Builder of 1872 speaks of his ‘polished intellect, pungent wit and well-stored mind’ and refers to an ‘extensive practice on the private mansions of some of the nobility and gentry’ for whom he created designs ‘of considerable skill and fertility of invention’, but of these little is known. His work is described as ‘marked by considerable originality and taste and great power of execution, for he was an elegant and artistic draughtsman’.

Some exploratory designs for Elton Hall — dated 1856 — survive in the archives, but little in the way of letters or detailed accounts. From 1857 to 1861, Ashton completely reconfigured the house, which had evolved on an L-shaped plan with a main 1660s block and a large room (originally the medieval chapel converted and extended in the 18th century) projecting east and linking to the gatehouse. He reversed the entrance from west to east, extended the main block by three bays and created new bed and dressing rooms. These were served by a separate luggage entrance, suggesting an emphasis on improvements for entertaining. Ashton also added to it a mansard roof of French character, but with English Baroque dormer windows (the latter detail curiously not as shown on the surviving drawings).

Meanwhile, he doubled up the projecting drawing-room range, building a second line of rooms facing into the court of the house against it. The new line of rooms included a new kitchen at ground-floor level — part of wider improvements to the servants’ quarters and services — as well as an ante-dining room and dining room above. Lighting the latter are three huge Gothic windows, clearly a modern re-creation of the windows of the former medieval chapel known to Ashton through early drawings of the house.

At the same time, Ashton removed the existing, 18th-century drawing-room chimneypiece and installed it in the new dining room. In its place, he designed an elaborate chimneypiece that gives the room overall a distinctly French tone. Beyond the drawing room, he re-ordered the library. The real triumph of Ashton’s work, however, is the Classical staircase hall linking the entrance hall to the principal drawing room, dining room and libraries. Externally, the additions are dignified by a tower. Curiously, the tower does not feature on any of the surviving designs, but it appears complete and in exactly the same stonework as the new dining room, in a photograph dated 1875.

The 3rd Earl finally moved in to Elton Hall in 1861 and correspondence suggests he thoroughly enjoyed the house until his death in 1868. His eldest son, Granville, the 4th Earl, who had been Comptroller of the Royal Household in 1859–66, inherited the property. His sister Lady Claud wrote to another sister that: ‘He wants at once to build stalls, hot-houses, and remodel everything on the extravagant scale he deems proper to his great rank — and for this he requires a quantity of ready money. He is not content at having an estate left to him in the most perfect state, and every charge taken off it, £25,000 a year clear without debt — but is furious’. He was especially cross that his brother William was left both money and the estate in Ireland where he rebuilt Glenart Castle.

The 4th Earl’s re-modellings at Elton Hall included two lodges, the re-siting of the kitchens, and a new billiard room and stable yard, under architect Edward Browning of Stamford in Lincolnshire (who also worked on the Burghley estate). The correspondence was fraught and there was a legal dispute, Browning writing gloomily of having got used to Lord Carysfort’s ‘naturally hasty manner’. Yet the 4th Earl had style: visiting in 1870, for the first time since the death of her father, Lady Claud confessed to finding the changes ‘painful’, but she admired the gilding in the Octagon Room, and thought the view from the drawing room framed by ‘red looped portice curtains’ created ‘quite a picture’, and that things were generally ‘splendid but in every good taste’.

His brother William inherited in 1872 as the 5th Earl. He removed an 18th-century Gothic tower from the house (attributed to Batty Langley) in 1883 and restored the inner library after a fire in 1893. His principal contribution was to restore the picture collection begun by the 1st Earl (a friend of Reynolds), and mostly sold on his death in 1828. The 5th Earl’s collection was carefully catalogued by Lady Claud’s grandson Granville Proby. His father, Col Douglas Proby, brought many of the contents of Glenart Castle in Ireland to Elton in the 1920s, including the castle’s fine 17th-century Flemish panelling, which was installed in the entrance hall, a project that required the room to be reshaped. Granville Proby sold Glenart and its remaining estate in 1943, as he thought the Germans were about to invade Ireland.

When Granville died in 1947, his brother, Sir Richard Proby, inherited — at the age of 61. Tackling major death duties, Sir Richard divided up the house to create flats at the north end of the range remodelled by Ashton and opened up the State Rooms, living principally in the pleasant rooms of the turreted early Gothic Revival block on the southern corner. He was given a baronetcy in 1952 for his wartime work on agricultural production in Huntingdonshire and died in 1979. His son, Sir Peter, was then in his late sixties, and Elton passed directly to his son, William.

When William and his wife, Meredyth, moved to Elton Hall in 1980, their daughter Alexandra became the first Proby heir to be brought up in the house for many generations. The Probys’ task was to make the house habitable again. Inspired by some of the country-house solutions achieved by Kit Martin, they created a new family kitchen by opening up two west-facing rooms (part of a ground-floor bedroom suite in Ashton’s 1856 plans). Gradually, they extended the family rooms (as three more daughters arrived) and reincorporated the post-war flats back into the house; firstly to make bedrooms for their children and then for guests. At the same time, they initiated an extensive plan for restoring the entire roof, rewiring and re-plumbing the house, with the help of Bowman’s of Stamford.

The rehanging and presentation of the collection was another challenge. Lady Proby, who began working for Christie’s not long after she and Sir William moved to Elton, attended various seminars on conservation and advice also came from experts such as Clive Wainwright and Helena Hayward, from John Cornforth and Gervase Jackson-Stops of Country Life and from Hugh Roberts. The Probys were also introduced to Alec Cobbe and, in 1983, he helped them rehabilitate the 3rd Earl’s dining room, then painted blue, hung with six pictures and used to display books from the library. The walls were painted a warm red (a deeper red followed some time later) and the magnificent curtains restored and cleaned.

The room was then rehung with considerable brio, with 46 paintings in a traditional tiered hang. The best Old Masters by Hobbema, Savery and Gerard Dou were all hung at eye level, with lesser works on the upper register. The adjoining ante-dining room has since been painted a pale warm green and hung with a concentration of the works of 19th-century British masters. Another project was the print room; a dressing room for Sir William designed by Nicola Wingate-Saul using original 18th-century prints.

From the mid 1980s, Lady Proby began to re-create the gardens first laid out by Edward Milner in the 1890s and then adjusted with advice from A. Hallam Murray, in 1911–13. The economies of the Second World War had led to a contraction of the gardened areas, compounded by the ravages of Dutch elm disease, and a new road development that had to be screened by a deep embankment and dense planting. Lady Proby initially found inspiration from a book by David Hicks on the importance of structure in gardens and, with the help of Peter Beales, the rose garden was replanted in 1983.

The overall layout and walks were preserved, with yew hedging added around lawns to create a formal, château-like atmosphere around the house, with views towards the trees and parkland — this also formed private areas for the family as the children were growing up. The Probys celebrated the Millennium by building an Orangery — designed in the Gothic spirit by Christopher Smallwood — with shellwork by Belinda Eade, set in a Mediterranean garden; a shell grotto temple was decorated by Charlotte Kerr-Wilson to commemorate The Queen’s Golden Jubilee.

After four decades of care and restoration, the final meticulously researched project, in 2016–17, was to replace the worn silk hangings in the drawing room, which had faded to a pale gold. The room is recorded with walls hung in a pale-blue silk in an 1818 watercolour and another view from the 1850s reveals a deeper blue, thought to have been installed by Ashton. These hangings were last replaced by a paler blue in 1895 (the names ‘C. Roeder Upholster’ and ‘W. H. Haynes, Artistic Upholsterers’ and the date were found above the door to the Octagon Room) and it was to this scheme that the room was returned.

The new silk was woven to its original colour by Richard Humphries, using the same damask pattern of the surviving silk; paintwork and restoration was done by Charles Hesp.

The Probys leave a legacy that illustrates the best sort of private custodianship. Through their care, visitors can appreciate in this one house the national story, as expressed in architecture, design and art.

John Goodall on the history and changing face of the buildings from the Middle Ages to the 19th century

Sometime between 1535 and 1543, the tireless traveller and antiquary John Leland visited Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire, the ancestral seat of the house of York. He was chiefly interested in the royal associations of the place with its great castle and collegiate church. Unexpectedly, however, he also recorded the burial here of one Richard Sapcote, whom he describes as ‘the setter up of his family in Huntingdonshire’, and the date of his death — 1477 — presumably read from a lost inscription. Having left the town, but ‘within a mile’ of it, the first landmark he noted across the River Nene in Huntingdonshire was the Sapcotes’ house of ‘Ailton’ or Elton.

Leland’s account is frustratingly laconic, but it authoritatively identifies Sapcote as a figure of significance. It also serves as a reminder that his family seat at Elton developed in the immediate shadow of a hugely celebrated and important group of — largely — vanished buildings. By extension, Sapcote’s choice of burial place in Fotheringhay, rather than at Elton, strongly implies a connection to the Yorkist dynasty. All this is helpful because details of his life are sparse and, in some details, contested.

Sapcote came into possession of Elton by 1451, probably through his marriage to a daughter of the Wolston family (her name is unknown). An unusual panel of impaled arms that must celebrate this match survives above the south arcade of the parish church at Elton with the inscription ‘Syr Richard Sapcote knyght’. He is likely to have acquired his knighthood in about 1469, when he became sheriff of Huntingdonshire. Presumably too, the arms predate his second marriage to Elizabeth Plessington (although the date of this match is uncertain).

This church panel is important because it helps date a closely comparable armorial of the Sapcote arms alone that is integral to the gatehouse of Elton Hall. By extension, it convincingly associates this building with Sapcote and dates it to about 1469. That would make it the earliest surviving part of the present house.

The gatehouse is a small, but sophisticated work of architecture. It was originally free-standing and is laid out on a rectangular plan, albeit with one section of the façade projecting forward over the gate passage. Both passage and projection are independently vaulted at ground level — the latter curiously opening out with archways to each side — creating two distinct entrance spaces. Its arcaded battlements step neatly around the building, curving around the outer corners to create turrets.

In the 1470s, the gatehouse stood on the edge of a water-filled moat, the line of which was discovered in the 1890s. Presumably, this extended to form a rectangular enclosure embracing other domestic buildings, but there is no modern trace of these or of the moat’s extent. The gatehouse was also approached through a base court comprising service and agricultural buildings. Overall, Elton Hall probably resembled other 15th-century moated houses with dominating gatehouses, as, for example. at Rye, Hertfordshire, or Hadleigh, Suffolk, created by wealthy figures outside the first division of patronage.

Judging from what we know about him, however, Sapcote might not register in this group and it’s really through the career of his son, John, that Leland’s assessment of him can be justified. John was elected MP for Huntingdonshire in 1472 and, in 1480, soon after succeeding his father, married Elizabeth Dynham, the sister and co-heir of John, Lord Dynham, and the widow of Fulk Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarin. This was an extremely advantageous match, which suggests royal favour; perhaps a connection with Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, mother of Edward IV, who was resident at Fotheringhay in the 1460s.

John’s brother-in-law, Lord Dynham, had cool relations with the last Yorkist king, Richard III, and, after the Battle of Bosworth, married the sister of Lord Willoughby de Broke, a close supporter of Henry VII. That alliance may have helped Sapcote to cross the political divide and enter Tudor service after Bosworth in 1485. Certainly, he was dubbed a knight by Henry VII on the battlefield of Stoke in 1487, where he clearly fought against the Yorkist forces.

Tudor service yielded rich rewards for Sapcote and he duly aggrandised Elton. That work may have begun in 1495, when the property is first described as a manor in its own right (also the year Cecily Neville died), but it was certainly under way at his death in 1501: he enjoined his wife by the terms of his will to ‘see and cause that my chapel at my said place of Alyngton be finished and ended according to the work there begun’. She obliged, despite remarrying the following year: in 1610, the antiquarian William Camden saw at Elton ‘a private chapel of singular workmanship and most artificial glass windows, erected by Lady Elizabeth Dynham the widow of Baron Fitzwarin’. Three years later, a visiting herald, Nicholas Charles, tricked the arms in the chapel, putting her patronage beyond doubt.

The chapel survives substantially intact. It stands at right angles to the earlier gate tower and comprises two vaulted chambers at ground level, one of which is the chapel of the house today. Above was the main chapel space, once lit by tall Gothic windows. The western end of the chapel was almost certainly first divided by a floor to create a deep balcony or ‘parclose’ overlooking the altar for the use of the family. This was accessed both up a narrow stair turret projecting from the south side of the building and from a two-storey bridge linking to the house itself, shown on early views.

In this regard, incidentally, the 1613 visitation is important. The herald Charles also records arms in the ‘parlour’ of the house, which echo the themes of the chapel scheme (and celebrate Sapcote’s second, Plessington marriage). This suggests that Lady Elizabeth actually finished the chapel as part of the complete reworking of the withdrawing apartments. It would conform to the planning of other late-15th-century sites — such as Ashby de la Zouch in Leicestershire — if, at Elton, the parlour and the great chamber over it connected respectively to the chapel and the balcony parclose. That, in turn, incidentally, suggests that the lost medieval house stood on the site of its modern successor.

Nothing more is known of the development of Elton until the late 17th century. During the Civil War, it was owned by the Cottons of Connington and the chapel may have suffered at the hands of Parliamentary troops, who ransacked nearby Peterborough Cathedral and were bought off from smashing the medieval glass at Fotheringhay.

In 1661, an agreement was drawn up settling Elton on Frances Cotton as part of a marriage portion. Her intended husband, Thomas, was the son of Sir Heneage Proby of Rans, MP for Amersham. Thomas succeeded his father in 1663 and a series of accounts preserved at the house and calendared by Granville Proby record the details of his life. They cover the cost of travel, plays, gambling, clothes and the complex demands of improving his estate.

As part of this last endeavour, he turned his hand to the rebuilding of Elton, demolishing the old house in March 1664 and building its replacement with the help of the mason Christopher Chapman and Fisher ‘the carpenter’ (whom he otherwise employed on other estate projects). He bought Ketton stone through his father-in-law, Sir Robert Cotton, and set up his own brick kiln to supply the works.

The earliest known view of Elton is by the Bucks brothers in about 1730 and shows what Sir Thomas created: a two-storey range seven bays wide, raised on a basement with a hipped roof and projecting block to the rear. Similar houses can be seen locally from the 1650s, such as Cobthorne in Oundle, but the design may have been provided by the architect Isaac Rowe, concurrently working on Sir Thomas’s London house on Pall Mall. The Probys moved in on March 22, 1666, but payments for construction, as well as furnishing and decoration, continued to be made into late 1667.

In its new form, Elton was approached from the east. That rendered the south-facing gatehouse redundant, but it continued in use as a muniment chamber (almost certainly its original medieval use); Sir Thomas’s will of 1686 mentions his ‘deeds and writings’ at Elton ‘kept lying in the rooms belonging to that building called the Tower’. The chapel seems to have been left in its original form, too, remaining so until at least 1721, when it was visited by the antiquarian John Bridges and described as having a wainscoted ceiling and ‘gallery’ (presumably the parclose) and two niches for statues above the altar.

It must have been soon after this visit, however, that this interior was transformed into the drawing room: the stair turret on the south side was expanded as a projecting window, the altar replaced with a fireplace and a new ceiling created. There is no documentary record of these changes, but the beam inserted to support the enlarged opening in the wall has been dated to the 1720s and Meredyth Proby, wife of the present incumbent, has pointed out the similarity of the plaster cornice to one at Ditchley, Oxfordshire, which dates from the same decade.

The resulting interior is difficult to parallel: a room with a Palladian ceiling, Gothic windows (the mouldings of the present frames show these to be adapted medieval elements) and a fireplace at one extreme. Presumably the work was done by William Proby, who died in 1739. In about 1750, his son or grandson, both called John, installed a new fireplace to the side of the room. This now survives in the dining room. It was probably at the same time that the outer angle between the chapel and house were infilled with a new block with linking octagon rooms and surmounted by a Gothic tower.

More important changes followed the succession of John Joshua Proby in 1772. He was a political reformer who inherited the Irish barony of Carysfort from his father. In 1789, after active involvement in Irish politics, he was created 1st Earl of Carysfort in the Irish peerage and was later rewarded in 1801, with a seat in the House of Lords. He was a keen collector of paintings and books and, in response to his preferments, engaged in the gradual enlargement and transformation of the house.

His chosen architect in 1791, at the start of the process, was John Carter, who drafted designs for creating a cloister walk against the back of the gatehouse. Carter was a notable antiquary and subsequently became famous as a polemicist and founding father of the Gothic Revival. It is doubtful, however, as to whether Carter oversaw the changes that followed the Earl’s elevation to the House of Lords. These involved doubling the depth of the 17th-century range and inserting a new front entrance to the rear of the house.

The 1st Earl also connected the gatehouse to the chapel by inserting an intermediary library building, recycling within the latter a window from the demolished house of the poet Dryden. Finally, in 1812–14, he added an extension, incorporating his own study and bedroom to the west of the building. In the process, the house assumed the form of a castle dressed in stucco with timber turrets and battlements.

Astonishingly, Elton Hall was captured on camera before 1855, when the extensive changes that created the modern house were begun by the inventive architect Henry Ashton.

Although it is not unusual to find country houses in England with such a depth and complexity of history, the ability at Elton to trace that process in both documentary and physical terms is very rare indeed. As the next generation of the family, Rory and Alexandra Aitken, prepares to assume responsibility for the house, it will be fascinating to see that story extended into the future.

34,"On my first day as curator of the Cruthers Collection of Women’s Art, Pat Larter and Lola Ryan’s artworks were shown to me in order to demonstrate the idiosyncrasies of the once-private collection. But what does it mean to describe artworks as “idiosyncratic”, especially if those artworks share a number of very striking similarities?

The works of both artists are on display in an exhibition titled Glitter at the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery in Perth. The formal similarities between Larter’s paintings and Ryan’s objects are obvious immediately. They share a neon colour palette, the use of decorative pattern and the liberal use of glitter. Both are also, in their own way, part of a dialogue about “women’s work”.

Different histories, similar responses

Pat Larter migrated to Australia from England in the 1960s with her husband, the celebrated, recently deceased artist Richard Larter.

Her own art aimed to parody what she described as “malegiven sexual stereotypes”, largely focusing on the ephemeral forms of performance and mail art. Like her ephemeral works, Larter’s paintings and embellished “super-scans” can also be read as gleeful yet critical parodies of masculine tropes of representation and abstraction.

Lola Ryan’s shellwork boxes, Sydney Harbour Bridges and wall hangings continue a tradition particular to the Indigenous women of La Perouse. The Sydney suburb is the site of one of the first missions to segregate Australia’s First Peoples from white settlement. Missionaries introduced shellwork to La Perouse in the late 1880s – with the practice growing into both an important source of income and a local tradition unto itself.

That both artists have come to their sensibilities via very different contexts makes the similarities between them more striking. What is also striking is the “narrative” of response to these works. Both – generally in the case of shellwork and more specifically in the case of the Larters – have been overlooked by collecting institutions in favour of the men around them. Both artists’ works are frequently described as idiosyncratic, kitsch or, less kindly, tacky.

Kitsch, class and gender

Factors specific to each artist have contributed to their position “outside” mainstream art history.

For example, as shellwork is a “post-contact” tradition, museums and galleries interested in Indigenous culture initially looked to more “authentic” representations, such as wood carving or ochres. Pat Larter’s mail art was made to explore transgressive and political ideas, ephemeral gestures passed directly between artist and audience. Her foray into painting was brief, interrupted by her death in 1996.

However, Larter and Ryan’s shared aesthetic suggests that material hierarchies of taste, and relationships between “good taste”, gender and class, also bear consideration when considering the responses to them.

Pat Larter is most frequently described as her husband’s muse – although their artistic relationship is more complexly collaborative. Richard’s paintings of his wife were infamously provocative, but they maintain material traditions, translating photographs and pop ephemera into paint.

In contrast, Pat Larter’s figurative “super-scans” use early digital printing and materials with associations that are more hobby-craft – that is, more feminine - than high art. The super-scans have met frequently with critical disdain, having been described as “tawdry home-made porn”, despite comparing in intent and composition with their acrylic-on-canvas counterparts.

The great conundrum of La Perouse shellwork is that while it is simultaneously “not to everyone’s taste” it also has great popular appeal. The key motif of the Sydney Harbour Bridge stems from the trade of the objects as souvenirs on the beaches of La Perouse. The women sold their work to day-trippers from the nearby colony – and its popularity in this context is likely to have contributed to the survival of the practice.

It’s only in the last decade that shellwork has made its way into the category of “art”. It’s this transition that tends to cause problems. As a souvenir, shellwork perhaps represents tastes of the buyer rather than the maker. As a cultural object, it represents knowledge passed between generations and the adaptation and survival of a culture despite adversity.

Aesthetically, though, shellwork bears all of the hallmarks of what would be described in the world of “high art” as kitsch. Lola Ryan’s shellwork in particular tends towards the more flamboyant end of this spectrum. It is gaudy, encrusted, veneered, domestically scaled.

If kitsch means a cheaper, poorly produced pantomime of something authentic, then Lola Ryan’s works are definitely not kitsch – and neither are Pat Larter’s. In both cases, the choice of materials is deliberate. Neither are they lacking in the critical distance that kitsch suggests. Each supports complex analysis and long looking. Placed in the context of their relationship with tradition and with history, neither is that idiosyncratic.

Taste is cultural, and like objects can be read as such. Taste changes – but it also plays an important role in what we preserve, who we celebrate and who we remember. Both Pat Larter and Lola Ryan appear to be in the midst of a “moment” - a renewal of interest in their work. This moment is a useful one to bring the persistent hierarchies of good taste and high art into the light.

Amazon Prime has finally revealed the trailer for “The Rig”, its supernatural thriller set in the North Sea.

The trailer shows the crew on board tackling the elements and a mysterious force as a fog engulfs them off the coast of Scotland.

Game of Thrones alum Iain Glen leads the team as OIM “Magnus MacMillan”, alongside Line of Duty Star Martin Compston as communications manager “Fulmar Hamilton” and Schitts Creek’s Emily Hampshire as “Rose Mason”.

The crew also includes Owen Teale as “Lars Hutton” and Mark Bonnar as “Alwyn Evans”, with the cast all having a link to names of real-life offshore assets.

The Rig is due to air on Amazon Prime on January 6, according to the trailer, having been shot exclusively in Scotland.

It will follow the crew of the fictional Kinloch Bravo, stationed off the Scottish coast, which will see them cut off from all communication from the outside world.

As they try to discover what’s behind the all-enveloping fog, “bonds are broken, allegiances formed and generational fault lines exposed” as they deal with forces “beyond their imagination”, Amazon said.

37,"David Krantz is a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability, where he serves as a cofounder and vice president of the student-run Sustainable and Impact Finance Initiative.

More than 200 institutions of higher learning have divested from fossil fuels or announced commitments to do so. This movement attempts to align their investments with their institutional values — but it is not the only way to pressure publicly traded companies to better address climate change. At Arizona State University, we students are working with our school’s endowment to change companies like BlackRock and Chevron from within. That has meant buying, rather than divesting, shares.

University endowments are investment accounts held in trust for students, typically managed by foundations and used to support scholarships and research. Schools are effectively shareholders, and shareholders have the right to vote — in person or remotely via a proxy ballot — on proposals submitted by the corporate board or other shareholders. These proposals can change how companies address climate. For example, last month shareholders at Chevron voted in favor of more accurate methane-emissions reporting, and those at ExxonMobil voted in favor of disclosing climate risks.

As partial owners of a company, shareholders also can request meetings with corporate representatives to express their thoughts on the organization’s plans — many of them have a staff dedicated to such dialogue, much like lawmakers often have people assigned to meet with constituents.

Along with voting proxies and proposing shareholder resolutions, these informal meetings are a potentially powerful tool in what’s known as shareholder engagement. While some activists take a hard line on divesting from any and all fossil fuels, my perspective is that engagement is a complementary strategy, like good cop/bad cop for Big Carbon.

But most university endowments are managed by asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which historically have often not permitted their clients to vote their own proxies and instead have voted the asset manager’s preferences. Additionally, students in general lack awareness of how endowments work, so they typically don’t advocate for a say in how they are managed.

At ASU, our involvement began in the fall of 2020, when an endowment staffer recruited 20 students to draft proxy-voting guidelines for the investment, which the school adopted the following spring. It was quite an accomplishment — we wrote 36 pages of rules to decide how the endowment would vote — but we were thinking even bigger. We wanted to change how university communities interact with their endowments and the companies in which those funds are invested. So we founded a student club called the Sustainable and Impact Finance Initiative to institutionalize our work.

We were given the chance to manage $1 million of the $1 billion endowment and prove that sustainable investing — ESG, short for environmental, social, and corporate governance — could be profitable. Arguably, it was a trap. If the university was truly interested in sustainable investing, then why dedicate just one-tenth of 1 percent of the endowment to that goal? And what would happen if our choices were not as profitable? Our failed effort could be an excuse to avoid ESG. Then again, if we accepted the offer, we could show that green investing can be just as profitable as Big Carbon.

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

In spring 2021, we selected investments in companies whose business models improve sustainability and that our research indicated would be profitable, such as solar, along with exchange-traded funds in ESG and clean energy. We also dedicated less than 5 percent of our funds to buy shares in companies we wanted to change, such as BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, and Chevron. Our allocations meet the minimum amount required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to initiate shareholder proposals. We set up a meeting with BlackRock.

BlackRock representatives came to the meeting prepared with talking points, the sort that could have been read from a corporate brochure on sustainability. But they were not prepared for our question: What could we at ASU, one of the world’s leading academic centers for sustainability, do to help BlackRock vote shareholder proxies to better reflect the values that it and our university profess to share?

Silence. The last thing BlackRock representatives expected from us was an invitation to help them do sustainability better, particularly in terms of proxy voting. Shareholder proposals often try to push companies to make greener choices. We told BlackRock that too often it opposes these proposals and, effectively, votes in favor of the unsustainable status quo. They have not accepted our offer.

This past academic year, we turned our attention to Chevron, America’s largest corporate contributor to carbon emissions. We met with corporate representatives and asked the company for greater transparency of its lobbying through third parties. Such information is key to understanding Chevron’s impact on policy, which we would like to see informed by the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Chevron’s lobbying report last year simply listed trade associations to which Chevron belongs and that may lobby on its behalf, or for positions it favors. Thanks in part to our engagement, Chevron released more data this year, providing ranges for the financial contributions it makes to each trade group, and adding a footnote to disclose donations to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures as well as to the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC — a disclosure for which we asked specifically.

Next, we asked Chevron to disclose its ties to groups that may not be lobbying, per se, but are nonetheless actively working to shape public opinion on climate, such as through greenwashing and disinformation campaigns. We also asked the company to disclose the methodology it uses to determine when the climate stances of trade associations — including the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron’s biggest beneficiary and a pioneer in climate disinformation — are misaligned with its stated climate goals. We hope to have a response by our next meeting, scheduled for November.

Change via engagement can be slow, but it does come. In late 2021, BlackRock announced a revision in policy, allowing some shareholders to more directly control a portion of their proxies — something that conservatives have hailed as a weakening of supposedly woke asset managers, but that we at ASU celebrate as an opportunity to vote for sustainability. This year, our student group has been deciding how to vote the ASU endowment’s proxies based on the guidelines that we developed.

We want to facilitate a nationwide network of student groups to participate in shareholder engagement through their university endowments. Together we can share best practices and leverage our collective investments to better hold companies accountable on matters of sustainability. After all, both the school and the endowment exist primarily to serve us students. We should have a say in the investments that help fund our education.

38,"It comes as no surprise that oil companies hire lobbyists to promote their interests in the halls of Congress. Every company hires lobbyists these days, particularly since John Roberts and his gang of rightwing thugs ruled in Citizens United that corporations are people and have every right to use their enormous financial power to influence elections and the government just like every other citizen.

America was founded on the principal that its citizens hold the sovereign power of the nation. That quaint idea has now been tossed into the dumpster as corporations assert their newfound power. Roberts, el al., never stopped to consider that 500 megawatt amplifiers like the ones corporations have at their disposal can easily drown out the voice of a normal human being.

Ever since Citizens United, the words “We the people” have been stricken from the Constitution and replaced with “We the corporations.” Politicians don’t even pretend to listen to their constituents anymore. All their time is devoted to the legions of corporate lobbyists who infest Capitol Hill and every state legislature throughout America.

So, no, it’s not surprising that Exxon Mobil hires lobbyists. What is surprising is to hear one of them state publicly precisely how far the company is willing to go in its efforts to protect its business model. Here’s what happened. Last month, a group of people working for Greenpeace UK’s Unearthed program contacted lobbyist Keith McCoy. During a Zoom call, McCoy gave them an earful about his activities on behalf of Exxon. Of course, the Zoom session was recorded and was later made public.

According to Newsweek, McCoy made no secret of the fact that Exxon has funded “shadow groups” to spread misinformation about climate science. “Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that’s true. But there’s nothing, there’s nothing illegal about that,” McCoy said. “We were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders.”

He also claimed he had lobbied several key senators to oppose climate change measures in President Joe Biden’s infrastructure and jobs legislation. He went on to list 11 senators who were key to Exxon’s lobbying effort — 5 Republicans and 6 Democrats.

McCoy singled out Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, calling him a “king maker” because his vote can decide the fate of any proposed legislation in the evenly divided Senate. Manchin is also chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. According to Yahoo, McCoy said he speaks with Manchin’s staff every week.

The other senators named are Republicans John Barrasso, John Cornyn, Steve Daines, Shelley Moore Capito, and Marco Rubio, along with Democrats Chris Coons, Maggie Hassan, Mark Kelly, Kyrsten Sinema, and Jon Tester. Coons is important because he replaced Joe Biden in the Senate when Biden became president and is reportedly very close to the president.

McCoy claimed Exxon is only saying it supports a carbon tax instead of carbon reduction mandates because it makes the company look like it cares about climate change. But it knows a carbon tax is highly unlikely to become law and so the odds are very much against any carbon tax.

“I will tell you, there is not an appetite for a carbon tax. It is a non-starter. Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans,” McCoy said. “And the cynical side of me says, ‘Yeah, we kind of know that.’ But it gives us a talking point. We can say, ‘Well, what is ExxonMobil for? Well, we’re for a carbon tax.’”

Just last month, the Senate stripped out many of the climate change provisions in Biden’s proposed infrastructure legislation. “If you lower that threshold, you stick to highways and bridges, then a lot of the negative stuff starts to come out,” McCoy said. “Why would you put in something on emissions reductions on climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill?”

Feeling more than a little full of himself, McCoy couldn’t help but brag about how the lobbying process works and how successful his efforts have been. “You want to be able to go to the chief… and say we need Congressman So-and-So to be able to either introduce this bill, we need him to make a floor statement, we need him to send a letter,” McCoy said. “You name it, we’ve asked for everything.”

Shocked. Shocked!

In a statement to Channel 4 News in the UK, which first published the recording with McCoy, ExxonMobil said its “lobbying efforts fully comply with all laws and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis.”

After the McCoy tape became public, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods released a statement, saying McCoy’s statements “in no way represent the company’s position on a variety of issues, including climate policy and our firm commitment that carbon pricing is important to addressing climate change. The individuals interviewed were never involved in developing the company’s policy positions on the issues discussed.

“We condemn the statements and are deeply apologetic for them, including comments regarding interactions with elected officials. They are entirely inconsistent with the way we expect our people to conduct themselves. We were shocked by these interviews and stand by our commitments to working on finding solutions to climate change.”

That leaves us to either believe that McCoy is an inveterate liar who can’t resist puffing up his own nefarious deeds to soothe his diminished ego or that he has pulled the curtain back on how business and politics actually work together in America to soft-pedal the most serious challenge to human existence since the dawn of recorded history.

Do we believe McCoy or Woods? Given ExxonMobil’s proven track record of hushing up the findings of its own scientists for decades about the looming danger of a warming planet and the role fossil fuels have played in that process, it is very, very hard to think Darren Woods is not being disingenuous as he beats his breast and pretends ignorance of any improper behavior by his minions.

Ultimately, it makes little difference what you and I think. But it does reinforce once again how the corporate world — especially fossil fuel companies — have kidnapped the US government and induced it to do its bidding, all in the name of perpetual growth and constant profits. If things continue as they are, the chances of avoiding a climactic cataclysm are virtually nil."

Oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is to study the potential for repurposing an oil and gas terminal for use in producing and distributing green hydrogen.

Alongside Grieg Edge, North Ammonia and GreenH will explore where the Slagen terminal in Norway can become a hub for low-emissions marine fuels.

As it stands the Exxon-owned facility is powered by hydroelectricity and could produce up to 20,000 metric tons of green hydrogen a year.

On top of that it has the scope to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of green ammonia a year.

sDan Ammann, president of Exxon’s low carbon solutions division, said: “Hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in key sectors of the global economy that create valuable products that support modern life.

“This study will explore the potential for ExxonMobil’s Slagen fuel terminal to help reduce emissions from Norway’s maritime sector and help achieve society’s net-zero ambitions.”

Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding between the partners, Grieg Edge, GreenH and North Ammonia will provide their expertise in sustainable maritime transport and hydrogen infrastructure.

Matt Duke, chief executive of Grieg Maritime Group, said: “Slagen is an exceptionally suitable location as a central hub for hydrogen and ammonia to the maritime sector.

“With the complementary expertise amongst the MOU partners, we have now taken an important next step in our efforts to achieve emissions reductions in the maritime sector.”

The International Energy Agency predicts hydrogen will meet 10% of global energy needs by 2050, and says it is critical to achieving net-zero global emissions.

Norway’s government has published a road map for hydrogen that includes establishing low-emissions hubs along the country’s coast.

The Slagen terminal is located at the opening of the Oslofjord, where more than 10,000 ships pass through every year.

Morten Watle, CEO of GreenH, said: “There is high value in producing green hydrogen close to where consumption is.

“At Slagen, bunkering of hydrogen could be offered straight from the production facility.”

CEO of North Ammonia, Vidar Lundberg added: “This MOU underlines our strategy to make ammonia available where there is market demand.

“We will also assess the potential distribution of ammonia from production facilities south of Slagen.”"
40,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a young technology — but it's already a major flashpoint in the political argument over how to approach climate change.

On the one hand, it's one of the only technologies out there with the potential to reverse some of the damage already done to Earth's climate — by (perhaps, one day) scrubbing carbon directly from the atmosphere and rendering it harmless. (Trees do something like that already, of course.)

It also can clean up the high-emissions industrial processes — such as cement manufacturing — that the world will still need after we all stop burning coal.

On the other hand, many environmentalists suspect that carbon capture is a distraction thrown up by energy companies desperate to avoid ending their dependence on fossil fuels. Some question its benefits — and most reacted negatively to its inclusion in the recent federal budget.

Pleased with budget

The budget offers a tax credit to companies that invest in CCS technology and says the government will undertake a 90-day consultation process to design the credit.

""We were instrumental in the budget and we were very involved with the Alberta government in pushing for it,"" said Beth (Hardy) Valiaho of the International CCS Knowledge Centre in Regina.

Saskatchewan has the world's only functional carbon-capturing coal-fired power plant — at the Boundary Dam 3 near Estevan. Last month, the project announced that it had removed four million tonnes of carbon dioxide from its emissions since it opened in 2014.

Process operator Bill Wingerak (foreground) works in the control room of a carbon capture and storage facility at the Boundary Dam Power Station in Estevan, Sask. on Thursday, October 2, 2014. (Michael Bell/The Canadian Press)

""That's roughly equivalent of taking a million cars off the road for a year,"" SaskPower spokesperson Joel Cherry told CBC News.

There's a catch, however. The CO2 from Boundary Dam 3 is piped away to an oil field, where it's injected underground to push out hard-to-recover oil from deep deposits. Although the carbon removed from coal emissions does remain underground, the CO2 is used to recover oil — which, when consumed, produces more atmospheric carbon.

And according to the federal budget document, projects that use CO2 to pump oil are not eligible for the CCS tax credit.

Carbon in, carbon out

The oil industry's use of CO2 is ""certainly an important aspect of making carbon capture economically viable as a generation option,"" said Cherry. It's a big part of the reason why the Alberta and Saskatchewan governments support carbon capture. It also helps to explain why many environmentalists distrust the technology.

Valiaho doesn't share their skepticism. ""We're very happy to see carbon capture, utilization and storage put in the budget,"" she said.

But she acknowledged the energy industry probably will use the 90-day consultation period to argue that CCS projects that use harvested CO2 to access oil deposits should still be eligible for the tax credit.

""I think there's some room in the consultation period to try and make that bit be correct for the way Canada operates today,"" she said. Such ""enhanced oil recovery"" operations, she said, make up the majority of the CCS projects that have moved forward. ""And of course, that return has been important.""

The Boundary Dam 3 carbon capture project was supposed to sequester a million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. This graph produced by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis shows the institute's evaluation of the project's real-world performance. (The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.)

Critics say re-purposing the carbon to extract more oil undermines the environmental logic of CCS projects.

""It ends up producing more oil, which in turn is then burned or used as an industrial feedstock, both of which emit CO2,"" said David Schlissel of the Ohio-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. He authored a recent study of Boundary Dam 3's CCS operations.

""When SaskPower claims that they've saved four million metric tons of CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere, technically that's true, but only if you apply it to the Boundary Dam plant.

""If you look at the full cycle, you need to take into account the extra CO2 that's produced from burning the new oil.""

A transitional technology?

CCS proponents argue that oil recovered through injections of harvested CO2 would simply be replaced by oil extracted elsewhere if it were taken off the market.

Valiaho said that because Canada can't stop using fossil fuels all at once, CCS can serve as a transitional technology, cutting emissions as economies switch to renewable forms of energy. She said oil harvested using captured CO2 accounts for about 37 per cent less carbon during its life cycle than does conventional oil.

""The fact that you can extract it even cleaner using an enhanced oil recovery process is only a benefit, as far as I can see,"" she said.

Schlissel questions that argument. ""Proponents of carbon capture and using it for enhanced oil recovery say that a barrel of oil that's produced in Alberta displaces a barrel of oil that's produced somewhere else in the world. And there's no clear evidence that that's true,"" he said.

""It may happen to some degree, but I'm very confident that the net reduction in emissions at Boundary Dam 3 is not four million metric tonnes. It's a significantly lower number.""

It works, with bugs

CCS technology is far from perfect, although those involved in the Boundary Dam 3 project say that they've worked out some of the bugs during its six years of operations.

SaskPower hasn't decided yet whether it wants to bet on the technology for the future.

""We're continuing to find improvements,"" said Cherry. ""We've achieved stable operations. We're still working to increase the efficiency of the project there, but we've passed some pretty significant milestones recently and we are getting more than a hundred megawatts of low carbon baseload power from that facility.""

SaskPower has decided already against expanding CCS to two more coal plants, BD4 and BD5, that are part of the Boundary Dam complex. It continues to study the option for two other plants, one of which isn't expected to reach the end of its life until 2047.

""It's going to depend on costs,"" said Cherry.

Carbon pricing changes the math

Valiaho said that oil recovery might make up a smaller part of cost-benefit calculations for CCS projects in the future as the cost of failing to capture carbon grows.

""When we now look at the carbon price in Canada going up to $170, this makes it a completely different economic case,"" she said.

The federal price on carbon emissions makes fossil fuels like coal more expensive to use, even coupled with carbon capture — which can only cut emissions, not eliminate them. Already, SaskPower has made a big commitment to natural gas generation and is looking at introducing small nuclear reactors in the 2030s.

And the company doesn't see any clear support for its own CCS program in the federal budget.

""Full details aren't going to be ironed out until after that 90-day consultation period,"" said Cherry.

""We're a Crown-owned provincial utility. We don't pay any tax. So with tax incentives, it's difficult to see what benefits we would get out of that.""

Texas troubles

Other players in CCS have encountered cost issues. Last year, NRG Energy mothballed a billion-dollar carbon capture project attached to a coal-fired plant in Sugar Land, Texas.

The Petra Nova plant had been running for three years and had received $190 million from the U.S. government. In a report NRG prepared for the Department of Energy, it acknowledged that the plant had been left idle for many days due to technical issues and had fallen about 17 per cent short of its carbon capture goals — although it cited the low price of oil as a factor in the decision not to proceed with the project.

But CCS is very far from dead. The CCS Knowledge Centre is involved in a feasibility study to install the technology at the Lehigh Cement Plant in Edmonton. Elon Musk has announced a $100 million prize for the best CCS technology. There is even a project afoot to capture and bury carbon from biofuels.

And now, ExxonMobil is floating a proposal for a vast $100 billion carbon capture project in the refinery row area along the Houston Ship Channel.

""We believe the time is right for a large-scale collaboration in the United States between governments at every level, private industry, academia and local communities to create an 'Innovation Zone' approach to dramatically accelerate carbon capture and storage progress,"" Joe Blommaert, president of Exxon's low-carbon division, said in a blog post last week."

This year's ""back to school"" fest begins today at the George R. Brown Convention Center from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., or until supplies last.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Saturday morning thousands of families and students headed Downtown for free school supplies as they got ready to head back to class.

The Back 2 School Festival was put on by the mayor's office, the Houston Food Bank, and Shell for those who may not be able to afford school supplies.

The event took place at the George R. Brown Convention Center until 2 p.m.

""We simply want to help prepare our kids for this upcoming school year,"" Turner said.

About 25,000 backpacks stuffed with school supplies were given away for free. Free health screenings and immunizations were also available.

As people deal with rising prices, parents said free school supplies and health services go a long way.

""School supplies, the food went up, gas went up. We are in inflation right now and people seem to not understand when you are in inflation, you've got to do what you've got to do, especially when you've got kids,"" Pat Wilson said.

Wilson attended the event with her soon-to-be third and seventh graders.

""It adds up very quickly. It's very expensive. I would say if we didn't have this help, we would probably be paying $300-$400 altogether,"" one parent, Kiera Carter, said.

Shell volunteer Belinda Salazar said she understands how stressful back-to-school season can be, with three of her kids still in school.

""I'm (going to) say each child is $200 or over. You have backpacks. You have lunch kits. You have clothes and shoes. Some (students) need uniforms, (and) some don't,"" Salazar said. ""I'm very grateful to be here volunteering and to be able to pack these backpacks for students who can use them and utilize them throughout the whole year.""

45,"India’s first tender for electric buses, which resulted in orders for 5,450 of them, has made the world sit up and take notice because no other country has bulk-ordered these many.

The Government of India-owned CESL, which is mandated to promote e-mobility, concluded this tender earlier this year, by aggregating demand from five States and putting out one single tender. Tata Motors bagged 5,000 buses, Olectra 300 and VolvoEicher 150. The juice of the tender was halving of the bus running cost to between ₹39-45 a km — which the State transport undertakings would pay the manufacturer-operators for running the buses on specified routes —compared with ₹85-90 for conventional diesel buses.

The buzz this has created around the world was palpable at the recently-concluded COP27 climate conference, where there were ample references to India’s e-bus programme, especially because CESL is now tasked with rolling out 50,000 e-buses in multiple tenders.

Now, the Maharashtra government wants to come out with its own tender for 5,000 buses, for which it has obtained an in-principle approval from ADB for a $400 million loan.

Carbon credits

At a conference in the India pavilion at COP27, many experts mentioned ‘payment security’ as the single biggest risk in bidding against e-bus tenders.

Against the backdrop of the poor financial health of the state transport undertakings, the big concern is what if the STUs don’t pay up. And that is where carbon markets enter the frame.

Mahua Acharya, CEO of CESL, who is also an expert in carbon markets, said that one solution to the issue of payment security is to sell carbon credits and put them into a payment security fund.

She said that each bus would potentially get 22 carbon credits per year because e-buses save carbon dioxide emissions that would have otherwise have happened from diesel buses. In the ‘voluntary market’ (where companies such as Google, Apple and Shell volunteer to buy carbon offsets to meet their own net-zero emissions targets), each carbon credit could sell for $10. Each bus could earn about ₹18,000 a year.

Acharya’s idea is to put this money into a fund, which could pay the e-bus operator in case the STU failed to pay.

Governments could be a big purchaser of carbon credits. The market segment in which the buyers are under an obligation to buy carbon credits is called ‘compliance market’ (as opposed to ‘voluntary market’, where the buyers purchase credits voluntarily, without being obliged to do so.)

The compliance market is still evolving, as the rules for it have just been hammered out. In the compliance market, the credits would sell for much more. Last year, the International Monetary Fund recommended that the price for a carbon credit should be $75, if global emissions should come down as required.

Therefore, carbon credits from e-buses could earn more robust sums, nourishing the possible ‘payment security fund’.

There is more good news. The ‘22 credits per bus per year’ calculation is if the e-bus batteries are charged with conventionally generated electricity. If they are charged with renewable energy generated electricity, each bus could earn 55-60 carbon credits. That would make e-buses more attractive not just environment-friendly-wise but also financially."
46,"Global Fresh Water Crisis, Peak Water

“It should be obvious from simple arithmetic that population growth is on a direct collision course with increasingly scarce resources.”

Jeremy Grantham

The notion of peak water probably sounds crazy to most people. The earth is 70% covered by water. The water cycle replenishes water on a continuous basis. The global warming enthusiasts tell us that glaciers are melting and oceans are rising. This should make water more plentiful.

But, as they say in the real estate business – Location, Location, Location. Freshwater shortages in the wrong places could have calamitous consequences to those regions, worldwide commodity prices, the economic future of nations with water shortages and possible war. Regional water scarcity means water usage exceeds the annual natural replenishment from the water cycle. The impact of water scarcity can be far reaching. It can lead to food shortages, famine, and starvation. Many nations, regions and states have mismanaged their water resources, and they will have to suffer the long-term consequences.

The peak oil debate gets a tremendous amount of press and generates heated disagreements on both sides. The focus on peak oil has permitted the future water crisis to stay under the radar. As usual, myopic self serving politicians have ignored resource issues for the last 30 years. These were 30 years of debt financed good times with relatively low prices for all natural resources and commodities. The end of this period of low prices is nigh. The brilliant investment manager Jeremy Grantham lays out the future in his recent newsletter:

“We must prepare ourselves for waves of higher resource prices and periods of shortages unlike anything we have faced outside of wartime conditions. In fact, I believe we are already several years into this painful transition but are still mostly invested in denying it.”

The following chart provides a useful comparison of oil and water as resources. While oil is non-renewable and limited, it is replaceable by other more costly alternatives. Water is renewable and relatively unlimited, but there is no substitute and it is only useful in the precise places. The Southwest region of the United States, our fastest growing region, has considerable freshwater constraints and could ultimately run out of water.

Facts & Figures

According to the United Nations, by 2020 water use is expected to increase by 40% to support the food requirements of a worldwide population that will grow from 6.7 billion people to 7.5 billion people. The U.N. estimate is that 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with extreme water scarcity. Even though 70% of the globe is covered by water, most of it is not useable because it is saltwater. Only 2% of the earth’s water is considered freshwater. Most of the freshwater is locked up in glaciers, permanent snow cover and in deep groundwater.

Desalinization is a process that can convert saltwater into freshwater, but it is only practically useful on the coastlines and it is 15 times more expensive. The middle of the United States is considered our breadbasket, where the majority of our food is grown. Drought and/or over-consumption of existing sources of water in this sensitive area would have worldwide implications, as the U.S. is a huge exporter of wheat, soybeans, rice and corn. The United States exported $115 billion of agricultural products in 2008 while importing $80 billion, according to the USDA. This is one of the few remaining businesses where the U.S. is a net exporter. Population growth and water shortages could change that equation.

The major challenges regarding freshwater are:

Tremendously uneven distribution of water on earth.

The economic and physical constraints of tapping water trapped in glaciers.

Human contamination of existing water supplies.

The high cost of moving water from one place to another.

Regional scarcity is not easily solved. Once the extraction of water exceeds the natural rate of replenishment, there are only a few options.

Reduce demand to sustainable levels.

Move the demand to an area where water is available.

Shift to increasingly expensive sources, such as desalinization.

None of these options is available for many areas in the Southwest U.S. The cities of Las Vegas, and Phoenix were built in the middle of the desert. The Hoover Dam, built on the Colorado River near Las Vegas during the Great Depression, created Lake Mead, the country's largest artificial body of water. The lake provides water to Arizona, California, Nevada and northern Mexico - but after several recent years of drought, on top of ever-growing demand, it's dangerously depleted. Housing developments on the outskirts of these towns have been stopped dead in their tracks by lack of water supply. The growth of these major U.S. metropolitan areas is in danger of going into reverse if their long-term water supplies are not secure.

Mike Shedlock noted the difficulties facing the Southwest in a white paper that he wrote on the subject of peak water:

“There is more water allocated to each user from the Colorado River than there is water to allocate. As long as some people are willing to sell their water, this isn’t an immediate problem. Chevron’s water rights for its DeBeque, Colo., shale oil project are leased, not sold, to the city of Las Vegas for drinking water. How will Las Vegas replace that in the future when Chevron won’t extend the lease? Many areas are using ground water that will be used up entirely in just a few decades.”

Potential Impact on Commodities

The United States, for better or worse, is a sprawling suburban dominated country with large supplies of freshwater in some regions and limited amounts in other regions. Suburban sprawl has put intense pressure on local water supplies. The millions of acres of perfectly manicured green lawns and millions of backyard “cement ponds” require vast quantities of water to retain that glorious green hue. The Ipswich River near Boston now ""runs dry about every other year or so,"" according to Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project. ""Why? Heavy pumping of groundwater for irrigation of big green lawns."" In drought years like 1999 or 2003, Maryland, Virginia and the District have begun to fight over the Potomac -- on hot summer days combining to suck up 85 percent of the river's flow. With 67 million more people expected to inhabit the United States by 2030, these water shortages will only become more severe.

Kansas is considered part of the fertile mid-section of our country that has allowed the average American to become morbidly obese. The story of Scott City, Kansas should be a warning to all farming communities in the Midwest. Mike Shedlock describes what happened to Scott City:

“Farmers around Scott City pumped with abandon from the underground reservoir called the Ogallala Aquifer in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s, raising record wheat, corn, and alfalfa crops, and never once worrying that they might hit ‘E’ on the tank fueling the economy. But today, in a withering downtown that no longer has a place for residents to buy shoes or dress clothing, some have likened the situation to a car running out of gas.

“‘If you run out of water for your crops, that’s one thing,’ farmer Kelly Crist says, recalling the day about a decade ago when his well went dry. ‘But when you go to your house and turn the shower on and there is no water, it’s a serious situation. Today, the 46-year-old farmer relies on an 800-foot-deep well that pokes into a deeper but smaller aquifer to fill his toilets, sinks, and bathtub.

“Water levels in the Ogallala, which stretches from Texas to South Dakota, vary in depth, and some communities have decades — or even more than a century — before the water runs out.Scott City sits atop a shallow portion of the aquifer. Water experts say that makes it a window into the Plains’ future.

“‘The area around Scott City is beginning to experience what the rest of the region is going to experience if we continue to pump the way we do,’ says Rex Buchanan of the Kansas Geological Survey. ‘If they keep going at the rate they are, it’s not a sustainable lifestyle. Something has to give.’

Food production around the world has begun to flatten or decline. The last 10 years have seen steady erosion in the amount of grain grown per capita. And since wheat and rice and corn are all world markets, with developing countries growing at a breakneck pace, the need for imports elsewhere could drive up the cost of food everywhere. The Chinese are relentlessly converting farmland to industrial uses (even as they continue to demand more meat and grains in their diet). The price spike in 2007 and 2008 was not a onetime event. It was a foreshadowing of a much more costly future for consumers. The U.N. said global food reserves in 2008 were at their lowest level in 30 years, which was good for only 53 days, compared with 169 days in 2007. Peak oil and peak water are misleading terms. They should be changed to peak cheap oil and peak cheap water. We’ll be able to produce oil and water for decades, but it will cost significantly more to do so. This will result in much higher commodity prices as farming requires prodigious amounts of oil and water to produce the food for the 6.7 billion people that inhabit the planet (8.3 billion projected in 2030).



More Dire Consequences



“In real life our species has such a modest ability to deal with distant outcomes or to defer gratification that a bad ending is probably inevitable. We need, it seems, the shock of a Pearl Harbor to really gear up and make sacrifices.” Jeremy Grantham

Americans seem to have a problem facing up to imminent threats until they hit them like a sledgehammer. This penchant for delay is going to cause much heartache and pain for most Americans. Hoping for a good outcome will not work. Thirty years of delay has set the stage for eventual conflict over resources. Peak oil is the more likely trigger for armed conflict. We know who has the oil – Middle East, Russia, Brazil, Canada. We know who needs the oil – United States, China, Europe, Japan. Peak water as a trigger for conflict isn’t on anyone’s radar screen. It is interesting that Brazil, Russia, and Canada also have the greatest amount of renewable freshwater on the planet. South America, which has 28% of the world’s freshwater and consumes only 6%, is the prize. Asia, which has 29% of the world’s freshwater, consumes 50% of all the freshwater on the planet. With high population growth and industrial development something will have to give in Asia.

A looming future crisis of food shortages and skyrocketing commodity prices is inevitable. Peak water will play a significant role in the crisis. The facts are undeniable:

Droughts in key farming belt areas due to climate change.

Less snow pack in the mountains resulting in less freshwater flows during growing season.

Contamination of freshwater sources by industrial waste.

Soil erosion and depletion of underground aquifers.

Higher oil prices resulting in higher fertilizer costs, food transport, and industrial agriculture.

Expansion of bio-fuels as an energy source.

Worldwide population growth, with developing countries expanding the diets of their middle class.

Subsidies and tariffs that protect farmers and distort market prices.

Inability to transport water economically.

War over resources has happened before and it will happen again. Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because the U.S. was cutting off its oil supply. The devastating combination of peak oil and peak water in the next five years will combine to create a commodity crisis that is likely to spur armed conflict as countries contend for declining resources. The question is who will attack who and when. In the meantime, plant a vegetable garden.

"
47,"This blog has been repurposed from the January-February 2020 edition of InTech.

The introduction of process safety system–specific malware into the manufacturing world in 2017 intensified the discussion around the convergence of safety and cybersecurity. If a cyberattack could compromise safety in the physical world, we must view cybersecurity in the context of safety. Similarly, approaches taken in the safety world to evaluate risk and to design safer systems must consider cybersecurity-related threats to the integrity of safety systems.

Key end user companies from the oil and gas, marine transportation, and offshore exploration and production industries discussed these and related issues in a session at the 2019 ARC Industry Forum in Orlando. In that session, Mark Duck, who is with the Shell Projects & Technology organization, talked about an approach Shell is exploring to integrate cybersecurity risk assessment into traditional process hazard analysis (PHA) methods.

For example, hazard and operability (HAZOP) studies could be used to determine the impact of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities on the safety of plant operations. Similarly, methods like HAZOP should be adapted to consider the cybersecurity risk to the integrity of the selected safety barriers for each specific hazard risk scenario.

These approaches are not limited to the oil and gas industry. They could be applied to an even wider range of industries, including those that are not the primary users of process safety systems.

The industry needs: (1) a clear way to think about how cybersecurity risk, if realized, could degrade the integrity of safety barriers, and (2) a standard methodology to assess this risk. In the first case, using a bow-tie model and the concept of escalation factors can help frame where cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities can affect safety barriers. In the second case, the industry has already taken steps to address how cybersecurity risk assessment can be integrated into the functional safety life cycle.

Figure 2. Example bow-tie model.

Cyberrisk viewed as a safety concern

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61511 Functional Safety standard now requires a safety instrumented system (SIS) security risk assessment. ISA has published a technical report (ISA-TR84.00.09-2017) that documents a SIS cybersecurity risk assessment procedure, called cybersecurity PHA or cyber PHA. The link to PHA is a step in the cybersecurity risk assessment process to: (1) review the output of the PHA to identify worst-case health, safety, security, and environment (HSSE) consequences for the asset, and (2) identify any hazard scenarios where the initiating event and all control barriers are “hackable.”

NAMUR has also published a worksheet (NA 163) titled “Security Risk Assessment of SIS.” A cyber PHA methodology can be used to assess the risk associated with identified cybersecurity-related escalation factors and recommend mitigations to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Linking concepts and tools used in the process hazard analysis world with cybersecurity risk assessment can help bring these two, traditionally separate, risk management processes together with a goal of improving the robustness of our safety systems against cybersecurity attacks.

Most cybersecurity risk scenarios only deliver a consequential business-loss consequence along with a potential impact on company reputation. PHAs, on the other hand, typically do not consider consequential business loss. But a cybersecurity risk assessment must include this consequence category, as shown in the example risk assessment matrix (figure 1).

This consequence category can be calibrated in terms of duration of production loss. The worst-case severity is calibrated by determining the maximum number of hours, days, weeks, etc., it would take to bring production back online in case of, for example, a ransomware attack that affects all servers and workstations in the industrial automation and control system (IACS).

The cost is the value of lost and deferred production plus the materials and labor required to respond to the incident. The list of systems required to bring production back online will likely be a subset of all systems in the IACS. From a cybersecurity risk scenario point of view, this list would be the critical systems, including all safety systems.

Shell’s process safety pedigree

Shell is well known for its emphasis on safety. The company takes a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to managing process safety risk including managing the HSSE risk associated with the asset process (a particular aspect of the chemical manufacturing process for example), integrity of safety barriers, risk to production loss, and other factors.

Shell uses many methods to evaluate risk in process safety that are consistent with those outlined in the IEC/ISA 61511 process safety standards. These include the use of risk assessment matrices that consider likelihood; consequence of risks to people, assets, community, and environment; and severity of the consequence. The company also uses bow-tie models (figure 2) to visualize the various elements of risk scenarios, such as hazards, top events, and barriers, including escalation factors and escalation factor controls.

A “hazard” is an agent with potential to cause harm. A “top event” is an uncontrolled release of a hazard, such as hydrocarbons, toxic substances, energy, or objects at height. An “escalation factor” is any situation, condition, or circumstance that may lead to the partial or full failure of a barrier (e.g., independent protection layer).

An example of this is making unauthorized trip setting changes to a safety instrumented function. This escalation factor could be controlled by improving the logical and/or physical access controls for the safety instrumented system. Identification of escalation factors is part of the process of managing the integrity of independent protection layers. These tools, among others, can be used to start the journey of integrating the process safety and cybersecurity risk assessment processes.

Figure 3. Partial bow tie showing threat and barriers including SIF with SIL and top event.

The challenge

Today’s challenge is to create an interface between process safety risk assessment methods and cybersecurity risk assessment methods. Historically, the HSSE risk assessment process has not considered sabotage (cybersecurity attacks are a form of sabotage). Given the level of sophistication seen in recent cybersecurity attacks on industrial control systems, the potential for simultaneous cybersecurity attacks on one or more independent layers of protection must be considered during the HSSE risk assessment process.

Safety instrumented systems and other control and recovery barriers have cybersecurity vulnerabilities that must be mitigated. These vulnerabilities represent “escalation factors” in the bow-tie model that must be mitigated with appropriate “escalation factor controls.”

One possible interface between the cybersecurity risk assessment and the HSSE risk assessment process is to focus on cybersecurity escalation factors associated with barriers that have cybersecurity vulnerabilities. One advantage to this approach is that it is already part of the existing HSSE risk assessment process.

It is common for one or more of the selected control or recovery barriers to be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Some examples are safety instrumented systems, PLC-controlled fire water pumps, and fire and gas systems— essentially any barrier based upon microprocessors running firmware/software and, potentially, connected to a network.

A cybersecurity escalation factor for these types of controls is the combination of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities associated with the equipment used to implement the control. In this context, cybersecurity escalation factors are just one type of escalation factor among many other types of escalation factors that can degrade the integrity of a safety barrier.

During a PHA, there is the possibility that the initiating event and all the control barriers selected for a hazard scenario have cybersecurity escalation factors. Where this is a high-consequence scenario (e.g., potential fatality), an effort should be made to add at least one control barrier that does not have cybersecurity escalation factors, such as a pressure relief valve or nonprogrammable safety instrumented function (SIF). If this is not possible, the cybersecurity risk assessment team should consider that a cybersecurity attack on these specific control barriers has a higher likelihood of leading to the top event, and they should identify a robust set of cybersecurity countermeasures to manage this risk.

Maintenance and cybersecurity

Industrial assets typically have a maintenance program to maintain the various components of the asset and must often prioritize work based upon some criteria. A common way to do this is to organize the assets in terms of system criticality. If a backlog of maintenance activities exists, then ensure the components with the highest criticality are taken care of first.

A common issue with cybersecurity controls in an industrial control system (ICS) environment is the related maintenance required to sustain them over time. Often, the maintenance associated with cybersecurity controls is a lower priority than instruments, valves, etc., because of the lower perceived value. One way to resolve this issue is to assign the cybersecurity controls used to manage cybersecurity escalation factors a criticality rating based on the barrier being protected, and then factor this into the overall maintenance strategy.

The need for doing cybersecurity risk assessments for process safety is called out in IEC 61511 Part 1 (2016). This requires that “a security risk assessment shall be carried out to identify the security vulnerabilities of the SIS.” The requirement further specifies additional details supporting the risk assessment.

Although this is a needed step, there are potentially many other safety systems, in addition to SISs, that are subject to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The following are examples of other programmable safety systems subject to cybersecurity vulnerabilities:

fire water pumps

tanker loading systems

ballast management systems (example: offshore semi-submersibles)

mooring systems (example: offshore semi-submersibles)

helicopter refuels

hazardous area ventilation

deluge systems

sprinkler systems

navigation aids

collision avoidance systems

communication systems

The trend to integrate these programmable safety systems with basic process control systems will likely continue and must be considered in the context of the IEC 61511 safety life cycle, which includes ensuring cybersecurity risks are adequately addressed. Considering these challenges, companies must make sure that cybersecurity risks to the availability of all barriers are understood, mitigated, and even “designed out,” where possible, during the PHA process.

Emergence of cyber PHA

This raises the question of how we develop a cybersecurity risk assessment that meets the requirements of the world of process safety. The concept of cybersecurity process hazard analysis (PHA) has emerged in the industry over the past several years and is finding increasing acceptance among end users. ISA and IEC cybersecurity standards have embraced this method. A methodology (and supporting information) for integrating process safety and cybersecurity risk assessment is documented in the following:

ISA/IEC d62443-3-2 (draft) – Security Risk Assessment and System Design

ISA-TR84.00.09-2017 – Cybersecurity Related to the Functional Safety Lifecycle

NAMUR Worksheet NA 163 – Security Risk Assessment of SIS

Several service providers have emerged over the past few years that have developed their own methodologies for doing cyber PHA that are consistent with the recommendations outlined in the standards. These companies range from smaller software and engineering service providers to large, integrated process automation suppliers.

Shell’s lessons learned

Shell concluded its ARC Industry Forum presentation by sharing several lessons learned from undergoing its own cyber PHA (based on ISA-TR84.00.09) assessments. Although some are not strictly cybersecurity related, they nevertheless emerged in a cybersecurity risk assessment. Awareness of these issues would benefit the ICS cybersecurity community.

For example, not all safety instrumented systems have a hardware key switch to manage the various modes of operation, such as “run, program, remote” modes. In cases where a hardware-based key switch is not provided, consider using a “software” lock to enforce separation of duties for the SIS. For example, the supervisor in the plant should unlock the SIS to allow the engineer to make configuration changes. Another example is making sure that critical SIS parameters such as “trip limit” cannot be changed online. A download, using separation of duties, should be required to change trip limits and other critical parameters.

End users should also pay attention to how the safety system engineering workstation user roles and associated privileges are set up. Companies should ensure that the “principle of least privilege” is enforced. In other words, minimize the number of people with privileged accounts and set up roles to support separation of duties.

Companies should also rigorously manage bypasses, and operators should have a real-time view of all active bypasses. A best practice is to use separation of duties to enable bypasses along with an administrative process that creates a record of the bypass. Rigorous management (or elimination) of remote access to safety system engineering workstations and instrument asset management systems (IAMS) should also be employed. Periodic audits of who has remote access should be implemented. Remote access by privileged users should be normally disabled, done under “permit to work,” and monitored locally.

Unauthorized changes to SIS instrument settings, such as sensor type, scale, or range, can render a SIF inoperable. This can potentially be done from the IAMS or through handheld devices used to interface with intelligent instrumentation. End users should ensure some form of “instrument lock” is in place, such as a hardware jumper or software lock. This will let them use separation of duty to make changes to instruments. Some end users have employed data diodes for this purpose as well.

Run periodic audit reports to detect unauthorized downloads to SIS or changes to instruments. Changes should match corresponding administrative controls such as “permit to work (PtW)” or “management of change (MOC)” records. If user accounts for the safety engineering workstation (S-EWS), human-machine interface (HMI), and IAMS are integrated with Microsoft Active Directory, risk assess the implementation to make sure these credentials are properly protected.

Good password policy should also be followed. Ensure that privileged account passwords are not leaked or shared. Use administrative policies that state this. If passwords are “stored,” do so in a secure manner. Do not pass around files with passwords.

Overall, companies should identify and address cybersecurity risks to safety barriers during design. Using concepts such as cybersecurity escalation factors and ensuring high-consequence hazard scenarios are mitigated using barriers without cybersecurity vulnerabilities can help achieve this goal. A cyber PHA should be included as part of any new project and as part of the contract when designing an automation system. Companies should perform a cyber PHA for existing assets when a change occurs that affects the safety system or when the cybersecurity threat landscape has changed.

There is still much to learn about the intersection of cybersecurity and safety. This requires collaboration between both communities for the continued protection of assets, people, and communities in today’s challenging cybersecurity environment.

48,"A severely corroded pipeline ruptured and spilled more than 300,000 gallons of diesel fuel just outside New Orleans late last month, according to federal records.

The spill from the 16in-diameter line operated by Collins Pipeline Co was discovered on 27 December near a levee in St Bernard parish, just east of New Orleans, according to documents from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

In October 2020, an inspection of the 42-year-old pipeline had revealed external corrosion along a 22ft section of pipe in the same area as the spill.

But repairs were delayed and the line continued operating after a subsequent inspection indicated the corrosion was not bad enough to require work immediately under federal regulations, according to the pipeline agency.

The spilled fuel contaminated soil and created a large pool of diesel in an environmentally sensitive area just a few hundred feet from the Mississippi River, the documents show.

An estimated 50,000 gallons of diesel were later recovered and cleanup of the remaining fuel continues, the documents show.

Collins Pipeline is a subsidiary of the Parsippany, New Jersey-based PBF Energy Inc.

Company representatives did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages seeking comment."
