0	WHEREAS: We, the shareholders, must protect our assets against devastating climate change, and we therefore support companies to substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company to substantially reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their energy products (Scope 3) in the medium- and long- term future, as defined by the Company.

To allow maximum flexibility, nothing in this resolution shall serve to micromanage the Company by seeking to impose methods for implementing complex policies in place of the ongoing judgement of management as overseen by its board of directors.

You have our support.
The policies of the energy industry are crucial to curbing climate change. Therefore, shareholders support oil and gas companies to change course; to substantially reduce emissions.

Fiduciary duty

As shareholders, we understand this support to be part of our fiduciary duty to protect all assets in the global economy from devastating climate change. Climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.

We therefore support the Company to reduce the emissions of their energy products (Scope 3). Reducing emissions from the use of energy products is essential to limiting global warming.

An increasing number of investors insist on reductions of all emissions

Shell, BP, Equinor, and Total have already adopted Scope 3 ambitions. Backing from investors that insist on reductions of

all emissions continues to gain momentum; in 2020, an unprecedented number of shareholders voted for climate resolutions. It is evident that a growing group of investors across the energy sector is uniting behind visible and unambiguous support for reductions of all emissions.

Nothing in this resolution shall limit the Companys powers to set and vary their strategy or take any action which they believe in good faith would best contribute to reducing GHG emissions.

We believe that the Company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to reduce emissions, inspiring society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, and allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with curbing climate change.

You have our support.

 Chevron shares the view that managing climate change-related risks and energy transition opportunities is vital to delivering superior long-term value. Chevron is taking actions that support a global approach to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible for society.

Chevron has established Scope 1 and Scope 2 metrics for Upstream oil, gas, flaring and methane and believes that the most appropriate approach for measuring the emissions performance of an Upstream asset is greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity by commodity on an equity basis. This approach ensures Chevron is accountable for all Upstream GHG emissions, irrespective of who is the operator, unlike many others who account only for emissions from a subset of assets in which they have invested. Consistent with the timing of the global stock-takes under the Paris Agreement, Chevron has set metrics for 2023 and 2028 and intends to do so every five years thereafter. Successfully achieving these emissions intensity reduction metrics is linked to most Chevron employees variable compensation, as reflected in the Chevron Incentive Plan (CIP) scorecard. Below is a table of the Companys adopted metrics:

The Company leverages its capabilities, assets, and expertise to focus on these three action areas that aim to deliver measurable progress: (1) lower carbon intensity cost efficiently, (2) increase renewables and offsets in support of our own business, and (3) invest in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions. Chevron believes the worlds continued demand for oil and gas should be supplied by the cleanest and most efficient producers. Chevron addresses Scope 3 emissions by taking the following actions:

 

 	1.	
Supporting a price on carbon through well-designed policies;

 

 	2.	
Transparently reporting Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products; and

 

 	3.	
Enabling customers to lower their emissions through increasing our renewable products, offering offsets, and investing in low-carbon technologies.

These contributions support a global approach to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible for society.

Chevron also prioritizes the most cost efficient and effective emissions reductions - an approach that is good for stockholders and good for society. Through 2028, Chevron plans to spend approximately $2 billion in carbon reduction projects. Further, Chevron has increased renewable fuels and products in its value chains over the last decade and plans to spend $750 million by 2028 in investments in renewables and offsets. Chevron also recently increased its commitment to invest in low-carbon technologies that address Scope 3 emissions, such as carbon capture utilization and storage and lower carbon energies by committing $300 million to the Future Energy Fund II.

Chevrons employees are proud of their role in providing affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy that people around the world depend on every day.

Your Board believes that Chevrons actions and reporting are appropriate and that the Companys strategy and method for setting emissions intensity reduction metrics effectively position Chevron to address future opportunities and risks. The Companys strategies, such as those outlined above, are intended to drive higher returns and lower carbon.

1	WHEREAS:

 

As evidence of the severe impacts from climate change mounts, policy makers, companies, and financial bodies are increasingly focused on the economic impacts1 from driving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to well-below 2 degrees Celsius below pre-industrial levels (including 1.5° C ambitions), as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

This focus has led many Chevron peers (including BP, Eni, Equinor, Repsol, Royal Dutch Shell, and Total) to commit to major GHG reductions, including setting net zero emission goals by 2050.2,3

Investors are also calling for high-emitting companies to test their financial assumptions and resiliency against substantial reduced-demand climate scenarios,4 and to provide investors insights about the potential impact on their financial statements.5,6,7

As of December 2020, Chevron Corporation had neither committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 across its value chain, nor disclosed how its financial assumptions would change from doing so.

In contrast, the audit reports for other high GHG-emitting companies clearly discussed this connection:

 

	 	
BP: how climate change and a global energy transition impacted the capitalization of exploration and appraisal costs and risks that oil and gas price assumptions could lead to financial misstatements;

	 	
Shell: how long-term price assumptions impacted by climate change could affect asset values and impairment estimates;

 

	 	
National Grid: noted estimates inconsistent with 2050 net zero commitments.

Additionally, in 2020, BP, Shell and Total reviewed their 2019 financial accounting practices in light of the accelerating low-carbon energy transition. All three subsequently adjusted critical accounting assumptions, resulting in material impairments, and disclosed how climate change affected the adjustments.

In October 2020, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a new Net Zero 2050 scenario which describes what it would mean for the energy sector globally to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

This more aggressive global action to curtail climate change is consistent with a 1.5°C temperature increase globally.8

RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Chevrons Board of Directors issue an audited report to shareholders on whether and how a significant reduction in fossil fuel demand, envisioned in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario, would affect its financial position and underlying assumptions. The Board should summarize its findings to shareholders by January 31, 2022, and the report should be completed at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.
Proponents recommend that in issuing the report, the company take account of information on:

 

	 	
Assumptions, costs, estimates, and valuations that may be materially impacted; and

 

	 	
The potential for widespread adoption of net-zero goals by governments and peers.9

Proponents recommend that the report be supported by reasonable assurance from an independent auditor.

Chevron believes the future of energy is lower carbon and aims to equip stockholders with data and facts so that they can make informed choices as the world moves toward the global net-zero ambitions of the Paris agreement. In March 2021, the Company published its third Climate Change Resilience Report aligned with the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The report outlines Chevrons approach to the energy transition, including testing the resiliency of Chevrons portfolio against the International Energy Agencys Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and Net Zero Scenario.

At its Investor Day on March 9, 2021, Chevron outlined the steps it is taking, and the challenges it faces, in working toward a net-zero future. This includes changes in portfolio, execution of projects identified through marginal abatement cost curves, and the policy, innovations, and offsets necessary to achieve net-zero.

Chevron uses long-term energy demand scenarios and a range of commodity prices to test its portfolio, guide investment strategies, and evaluate business risks to ensure it can deliver results under a range of potential futures. Chevron analyzes how various factors may combine to create alternative scenarios to stress-test its portfolio and integrate learnings into its decision making to remain competitive and resilient under multiple scenarios.

For longer-term scenarios, Chevron routinely uses external views to both inform and challenge its internal analysis. Chevrons analysis includes scenarios forecasting emissions pathways that keep global warming to well below 2o C above pre-industrial levels, as well as scenarios forecasting net-zero emissions by 2050.1 One example of a lower carbon scenario tested against Chevrons portfolio is the SDS. The SDS outlines one potential path to 2040 that achieves the objectives of recent clean energy policies, including the Paris Agreement, keeping global average temperatures well below 2o C above pre-industrial levels and putting the world on track to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.

In 2020, more than 60 percent of Chevrons total Scope 1 and Scope 2 equity GHG emissions were in regions with existing or developing carbon pricing policies.2 Chevron uses carbon prices and derived carbon costs in business planning, investment decisions, impairment reviews, reserves calculations, and assessment of carbon reduction opportunities. We believe that the Companys portfolio is resilient, and that its governance structure, risk management, strategy, actions, and asset mix enable it to be flexible in response to potential changes in supply and demand, even in lower carbon scenarios.

The Company leverages its capabilities, assets, and expertise to focus on these three action areas that aim to deliver measurable progress: (1) lower carbon intensity cost efficiently, (2) increase renewables and offsets in support of our own business, and (3) invest in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions.

Chevrons employees are proud of their role in providing affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy that people around the world depend on every day.

Given Chevrons current disclosures and robust strategy, planning, and risk management processes, your Board believes that the requested report is unnecessary.

2	Whereas: Our Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in 2019, signed a Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, committing our Company to all stakeholders, including protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainability practices across our businesses.

Yet, inconsistent with our Companys embrace of sustainability, Chevron has declined to develop business goals consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and, unlike peers, has not set net zero emissions goals for 2050.

Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy according to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The National Bureau of Economic Research warns if greenhouse gases are not cut in line with the Paris Accord, United States GDP could be cut 10.5 percent by 2100. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and Principles for Responsible Investment reports in the paper Universal Ownership that over 50 percent of companies earnings are at risk from climate costs, creating systemic risk for diversified investors.

Universal investors-those with highly-diversified portfolios representative of the broad economy-are exposed to growing and widespread climate costs generated by some companies, including Chevron, and ultimately incurred by other companies. The Proponent is quoted in Universal Ownership:

A portfolio investor benefiting from a company externalizing costs might experience a reduction in overall returns due to these externalities adversely affecting other investments in the portfolio,           

and hence overall market return. For a diversified investor, there is no place to hide from these costs: they come back into the portfolio as taxes, insurance premiums, inflated input prices and the physical cost of disasters. (Seitchik)

It is in investors interest to reduce climate externalities to protect long-term returns. In contrast, Chevron appears to prioritize our Companys financial returns over the impact of climate change on global markets.

The State of Delaware has adopted and recently amended a law allowing our Company to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) by amending our Companys Certificate of Incorporation to establish a public purpose, such as promoting a sustainable global economy, consistent with our CEOs statement to commit our company to all stakeholders; and

In the opinion of the proponent, the approach of this law seems consistent with our CEOs commitment to the Statement, providing the opportunity for the board to legally articulate the purpose of our corporation in a manner that would reconcile its accountability to all stakeholders, be it therefore

Resolved, that shareholders request the board of directors to approve an amendment to the companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) pursuant to Delaware law, and to submit the proposed amendment to shareholders for our approval. Such a change would enable the company to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that balances the stockholders pecuniary interests, and the best interests of those materially affected by the corporations conduct.
The Business Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation sets forth commitments in five key areas: delivering value to customers; investing in employees; dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers; supporting communities in which we work; and generating long-term value for stockholders. Chevron has a long track record of success in each of these five areas and remains dedicated to these principles because they have always contributed to the long-term, sustainable health of our Company.

Chevron engages with stakeholders, including investors, civil society organizations, customers, and others, to inform its approach to its social and environmental responsibilities. Expectations continue to rise, and responding to these expectations is a responsibility Chevron takes seriously. Our ability to continue to create value for stakeholders depends on maintaining financial, operational, and cultural strength  and we are committed to doing so.

Chevrons social investments strive to empower people to improve their lives and meet their full potential. Partnerships in health, education, and economic development advance progress and strengthen communities. Moreover, our employees, retirees, and contractors apply their skills, and contribute their resources, in volunteer activities that help improve education, provide basic needs, foster new business opportunities, and ultimately strengthen the communities in which we operate.

Chevron addresses the risks and opportunities presented by the global transition toward a lower-emissions energy system through its three strategic action areas: (1) lower carbon intensity cost efficiently, (2) increase renewables and offsets in support of our own business, and (3) invest in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions.

Chevron has established equity-basis greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction metrics to achieve goals related to activities over which it has financial or operational influence. Chevron believes in establishing metrics on an equity-basis, per commodity, and on an intensity basis, up to the point of sale, in a verifiable, tradable manner to transparently measure the efficiency of production for each product. Chevron set Upstream equity net GHG intensity reduction goals for 2028 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 24 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per barrels of oil-equivalent (boe) for oil or gas production carbon intensity, zero routine flaring by 2030, 3 kg CO2e/boe for flaring intensity, and 2 kg CO2e/boe for methane intensity, along with a methane detection plan.1 Successfully achieving these metrics is linked to most Chevron employees variable compensation.

Chevron has a strong corporate governance structure to enable the Company to meet the rising expectations of stakeholders. Chevrons Board of Directors conducts an annual review with executive management that identifies significant financial, operational, market, political, environmental, and other risks. The Board oversees Chevrons risk management policies and practices to assess whether the appropriate systems are employed. The Boards Public Policy and Sustainability Committee monitors the social, political, environmental, human rights, and public policy aspects of Chevrons business and the communities in which it operates.

Your Board believes that Chevron operates in a responsible and sustainable manner, furthering the interests of many stakeholders, which directly contributes to the long-term health and growth of our business. Converting to a public benefit corporation is unnecessary and not an appropriate way to ensure the Company meets its social and environmental responsibilities.

3	Whereas, we believe in full disclosure of Chevrons lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether its lobbying is consistent with Chevrons expressed goals and in stockholders best interests.

Resolved, the stockholders of Chevron request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing:

 

1.	
Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.

 

2.	
Payments by Chevron used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.

 

3.	
Chevrons membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.

4.	
Description of managements and the Boards decision-making process and oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above.

For purposes of this proposal, a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. Indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Chevron is a member.

Both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.

The report shall be presented to the Public Policy Committee and posted on Chevrons website.

 
 

Supporting Statement:

 

 

Chevron spent $84,560,000 on federal lobbying from 2010  2018. This does not include state lobbying, where Chevron also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Chevron spent $35,124,804 lobbying in California from 2010  2018. Chevron also lobbies abroad, spending between 1,000,0001,249,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2018.

We commend Chevron for now disclosing its largest trade associations. Chevron belongs to the Business Roundtable (BRT), Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), which spent $127,448,048 on lobbying for 2018. Both the BRT and NAM are lobbying against shareholder rights to file resolutions. Chevron does not disclose its payments to trade associations nor amounts used for lobbying. And Chevron does not disclose its payments to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

We are concerned that Chevrons lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, Chevron supports the Paris climate agreement, yet a 2019 InfluenceMap report found Chevron has spent millions lobbying to undermine it.1 And Chevrons ALEC membership has drawn scrutiny.2 Investors participating in the Climate Action 100+ representing $34 trillion in assets are asking companies to align their lobbying with the goals of the Paris agreement. Peer Shell produced an Industry Associations Climate Review report to ensure its trade association participation aligned with its views.3

We believe reputational damage stemming from misalignment between policy positions and actual direct and indirect lobbying efforts harms long-term value creation by Chevron. Thus, we urge Chevron to expand its lobbying disclosure.

Chevron advocates on behalf of its employees and stockholders to support its commitment to deliver affordable, reliable and cleaner energy. Chevron strives to maintain positive, constructive relationships with policymakers and their staffs to help inform them about the impacts of potential legislation or rule changes. Chevron does this with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all laws governing lobbying activities and disclosure. Chevron believes it is essential to engage with policymakers and express the Companys views on pending policy proposals through direct and indirect lobbying and participation in a diverse range of business and policy organizations that advocate for free markets and responsible energy legislation and regulations. Chevron lobbies ethically, constructively, and in a non-partisan manner.

To further these efforts, Chevron holds membership in trade associations that provide expert perspectives on many issues. Trade associations also provide a venue for Chevron to engage with other companies and industry experts. Chevron does not agree with all positions of every industry, trade, or policy organization in which it participates. However, Chevron believes that participation in these organizations provides the Company with the best opportunity to influence their positions in a manner that aligns with the long-term interests of Chevron stockholders.

Chevron agrees that transparency and accountability are important aspects of corporate political activity. That is why Chevron provides extensive disclosure of these activities on its website by listing all jurisdictions where we are registered to lobby with links to access our reports. This disclosure goes beyond what is required by law. The Companys lobbying activities in the United States are strictly regulated by federal, state, and local lobbying laws. Each governing jurisdiction determines its own laws and regulations regarding lobbying compliance and what activities must be reported. Chevron also discloses on its website not just lobbying activities, but all political contributions. The information on the website includes:

 

??Chevrons lobbying activities, political contributions, philosophy, and oversight mechanisms

 

??U.S. trade association memberships

 

??Federal and state lobbying reports

 

??Federal lobbying contributions

 

??Chevrons most recent annual Corporate Political Contributions report and the Chevron Employee Political Action Committee contribution report.

In addition, in December 2020, in response to stockholder interest, Chevron published a special report on climate lobbying. This report further describes Chevrons lobbying strategies and governance to ensure its trade association memberships are in alignment with Chevrons interests with respect to climate change issues.

All of Chevrons political and lobbying activities are subject to thorough review and oversight. The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors annually reviews Chevrons lobbying activities and budget to assess the value of these activities and ensure alignment with Chevrons positions and interests. Senior Chevron staff annually review trade association memberships to consider their value to the business. They also review policies, procedures, and expenditures for political activities. Chevrons employees are required to complete political and lobbying compliance training. We also take the extra step to review any contributions and lobbying through the lens of current and past events. We are committed to supporting strong energy allies who promote democracy.

Chevron has, for many years now, provided significant disclosure on its lobbying activities and expenditures and has a practice of periodically evaluating and improving the scope and quality of disclosure. Chevron will continue this practice of transparency. Your Board is confident that the Companys political activities are aligned with Chevrons goals and the long-term interests of our stockholders. Your Board encourages you to review the reports and other materials described above.

4	RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require that whenever possible the Chair of the Board of Directors be an independent member of the Board. This policy would phase in for the next CEO transition.

If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, within a reasonable period it shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of this policy. Compliance with this policy can be waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.

 
 

SUPPORTING STATEMENT

 

 

We believe that inadequate board oversight has led to management mishandling of a number of issues, which has increased both risk and cost to stockholders.

For example, Chevron mishandled risk related to an ongoing legal effort by communities in Ecuador to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment for oil pollution. When Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001, it inherited significant legal, financial, and reputational liabilities that stemmed from pollution of the water and lands of communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 2018, Ecuadors Constitutional Court unanimously confirmed a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron.

Chevron has acknowledged the serious risk from enforcement of the $9.5 billion judgment. Deputy Controller Rex Mitchell testified, under oath, that such seizures of Company assets would cause significant, irreparable damage to Chevrons business reputation and business relationships. However, instead of negotiating a swift, reasonable, and comprehensive settlement with the affected Ecuadorian communities, management has pursued a costly and protracted legal strategy that has lasted more than two decades.

As well, investors are concerned that Chevron has not adequately addressed climate change  a massive risk that is already manifest and set to intensify over time via regulation, energy price swings, and growing uncertainty around the value of fossil fuel reserves. Chevron has published a climate risk scenario report and attempted to reduce capital spending; however, investor concerns remain because:

 

	 	
Of Chevrons December 2019 announcement of a $10 billion+ write-down on the value of its assets.

	 	
Climate-related tort claims and similar litigation against Chevron are mounting.

 

	 	
Chevrons climate risk reports have downplayed significant factors, such as potential competition from low-carbon energy technologies.

 

	 	
Chevron has supported lobbying and trade associations that spread dis-information on climate science and policy, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the American Petroleum Institute (API).

In addition, inadequate board attention could intensify ongoing risks and controversies related to global operations  such as renewed attacks on Chevrons Nigeria assets in 2016, controversy over operations in Myanmar (given United Nations reports of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by the Burmese army against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities in Burma), and a landmark enforcement action against Chevron for alleged tax evasion in Australia.

An independent Chair would improve oversight of management, and the attention paid to long-range risks such as those noted above.

THEREFORE: Please vote FOR this common-sense governance enhancement.
As required by Chevrons By-Laws, the independent members of your Board elect the Board Chairman annually after reviewing whether to elect the CEO or another Director to serve as Chairman. The Board thus has great flexibility to choose the optimal leadership for the Board depending upon Chevrons particular needs and circumstances at the time.

Currently, the Board has appointed Michael K. Wirth to serve as CEO and as Chairman of the Board. Your Board believes that Chevron and its stockholders benefit from the resulting unity of leadership and companywide strategic alignment. For example, as a global energy company that negotiates concessions and leases with host-country governments around the world, we believe it is generally advantageous to the Company for the CEO to represent the Chevron Board as its Chairman in such dialogues. Your Board does recognize the importance of independent oversight of the CEO and management, and it has instituted structures and practices to enhance such oversight. When the CEO is elected Chairman, the independent Directors annually elect a Lead Director from among themselves. The role of the Lead Director is highly empowered, as described in the Independent Lead Director section of this Proxy Statement on page 22. See also Board Leadership Structure on page 21.

As part of each Board meeting, the independent Directors meet in executive session without members of management present. They use this opportunity to discuss any matters they deem appropriate, including evaluation of senior management, CEO and management succession, Chevrons operating and financial performance and returns to stockholders, and Board priorities, among others.

A fixed policy requiring a separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO is also unwarranted because of Chevrons many other strong corporate governance practices, including the following: the annual election of all Directors; a majority vote requirement in uncontested elections of Directors; an overwhelming majority of independent Directors; proxy access; independent Director access to employees; and publicly available Corporate Governance Guidelines. The independent oversight of Chevrons Board leadership is further supported by strong Board refreshment, multidimensional diversity among its Directors, and regular rotation of Committee chairpersons and of the Lead Director, all of which ensures that new perspectives are brought to the selection of Chevrons Chairman and to other critical Board decisions.

Although the proposal purports to relate to the Boards leadership structure, its supporting statement shows that it is a vehicle to discuss the Ecuador litigation. Yet, the $9.5 billion Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron has been thoroughly discredited by every court and tribunal outside Ecuador that has reviewed the matter. In 2014, a federal court in New York found that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and was unenforceable in the United States. The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed that finding, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review, rendering the federal courts ruling final.

In a separate action, in 2018, an international tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued a unanimous award in favor of Chevron, finding that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and that it was based exclusively on environmental claims settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier. The tribunal concluded that as a matter of international law, the judgment should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague upheld the award, highlighting that Ecuador acknowledges that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent ([t]he fraudulent character of the judgment and the proceedings preceding it is common ground between [Chevron and Ecuador]), a fact Ecuador also admitted in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020 (referring to the Ecuadorian judgment as fraudulent). Finally, plaintiffs recognition and enforcement proceedings outside Ecuador have failed in every jurisdiction in which they have been attempted to date, namely Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. Your Board expects Chevrons management to continue vigorously defending against this fraud.

Given strong independent Board oversight of the CEO and management and the Companys corporate governance practices, including an empowered and effective independent Lead Director, your Board does not believe that a fixed policy requiring an independent Chairman is in the best interests of stockholders. Rather, your Board believes that stockholder interests are best served when Directors have the flexibility to determine the best person to serve as Chairman, recognizing that no single leadership model is appropriate in all circumstances.

5	RESOLVED: Shareowners request that the Board of Chevron Corporation (Chevron or Company) take the steps necessary to amend Company bylaws and appropriate governing documents to give holders of 10% of outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowners

meeting. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such bylaw text in regard to calling a special meeting shall not contain exceptions or excluding conditions that apply only to shareowners but not to management or the Board.

 
 

Supporting Statement:

 

 

This Proposal grants shareowners the ability to consider important matters which may arise between annual meetings, and augments the Boards power to itself call a special meeting. This Proposal earned the support of 35% of shares voted in 2019, representing approximately $54 billion in shareholder value.

We believe management has mishandled a variety of issues in ways that significantly increase both risk and costs to shareholders. The most pressing of these issues is the ongoing legal effort by communities in Ecuador to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron for oil pollution.

When Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001, it inherited significant legal, financial, and reputational liabilities that stemmed from pollution of the water and lands of communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon. For two decades the affected communities brought suit against Texaco (and subsequently Chevron). The case reached its conclusion in 2018 when Ecuadors Constitutional Court, in an 8-0 decision, confirmed a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron.

Instead of negotiating an expedient, fair, and comprehensive settlement with the affected communities in Ecuador, Chevron pursued a costly legal strategy that lasted for more than two decades. In the course of these proceedings,

Chevrons management made significant missteps, including moving the case from New York to Ecuador. In an unprecedented move, Chevron harassed and subpoenaed stockholders who questioned the advisability of the Companys legal strategy.

Chevron has acknowledged the serious risk enforcement of the $9.5 billion judgment represents. Under oath, Deputy Controller Rex Mitchell testified that such seizure of Company assets: would cause significant, irreparable damage to Chevrons business reputation and business relationships.

However, Chevron has yet to fully report these risks in either public filings or statements to shareholders. As a result, investors have requested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigate whether Chevron violated securities laws by misrepresenting or materially omitting information in regard to the multi-billion Ecuadoran judgment.

Shareholders urgently need a reasonable 10% threshold to call special meetings.

THEREFORE: Vote FOR this common-sense governance enhancement that would improve shareholder communication and protect shareholder value.
Chevrons By-Laws permit stockholders owning 15 percent of Chevrons outstanding common stock to call for a special meeting. Your Board continues to believe that Chevrons 15 percent threshold ensures that a reasonable number of stockholders considers a matter important enough to merit a special meeting. Preparing for and holding a special meeting is time-consuming and expensive. The 15 percent threshold helps avoid waste of Company and stockholder resources to address narrow or special interests.

In addition to a lower threshold, the proposal would permit a special meeting without appropriate and reasonable limitations. Chevrons By-Laws currently contain two important limitations. A special meeting cannot be called (1) if the Board has already called or will call an Annual Meeting of stockholders for the same purpose specified in the special meeting request or (2) if an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request for a special meeting was received and included the purpose specified in the special meeting request. Given the time and cost associated with special meetings, your Board believes that these are appropriate and reasonable limitations. Moreover, the issues raised in support of this proposal already are consistently discussed at Chevrons Annual Meetings.

Stockholders can be assured that their right to be apprised of and vote on significant matters is protected not only by their existing right to call for special meetings and participate in Chevrons Annual Meetings, but also by state law and other regulations. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware, which requires that major corporate actions, such as a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of Chevrons assets, be approved by stockholders. Chevron is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the NYSE requires, among other things, that listed companies obtain stockholder approval for equity compensation plans and significant issuances of equity securities to related parties and for when such issuances represent more than 20 percent of an issuers voting power. Chevron has robust corporate governance practices to protect stockholder interests, including a declassified Board; proxy access; no supermajority voting provisions in its By-Laws and Certificate of Incorporation; and a strong independent Board structure.

Finally, although the proposal purports to relate to special meetings, its supporting statement shows that it is a vehicle to discuss the Ecuador litigation and related actions against Chevron. The proponent implies that special meetings are an appropriate vehicle for pressuring the Company to succumb to the demands in the Ecuador litigation and pay a judgment secured through fraud and corruption. Your Board believes, and several prominent courts and international tribunals have now confirmed, that the Ecuador litigation is the product of fraud, bribery, and corruption.

In 2014, a federal court in New York found that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and was unenforceable in the United States. The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed that finding, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review, rendering the federal courts ruling final.

In a separate action, in 2018, an international tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued a unanimous award in favor of Chevron, finding that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and that it was based exclusively on environmental claims settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier. The tribunal concluded that as a matter of international law, the judgment should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague upheld the award, highlighting that Ecuador acknowledges that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent ([t]he fraudulent character of the judgment and the proceedings preceding it is common ground between [Chevron and Ecuador]), a fact Ecuador also admitted in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020 (referring to the Ecuadorian judgment as fraudulent).Finally, plaintiffs recognition and enforcement proceedings outside Ecuador have failed in every jurisdiction in which they have been attempted to date, namely, Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Your Board expects Chevrons management to continue vigorously defending against this fraud.

Your Board continues to believe its current By-Law is in the stockholders best interests and provides appropriate and reasonable limitations on the right to call special meetings.

1	In a series of reports since 2011, Carbon Tracker has shown the financial and stranded asset risks to fossil fuel producers related to the shift to a lower carbon economy, in a world where stabilising global temperatures to any level puts a finite limit on the amount of CO 2 that we can emit (“the carbon budget”).

Carbon Tracker has looked at the risk of investing in “stranded assets” – projects that fail to deliver adequate returns as conditions change.

In this report, we look at potential capital expenditure (“capex”) that might be spent on such stranded assets in the oil and gas industry using an economic framework, and focus on company and project level results. This report updates previous work on this theme, Carbon Tracker’s 2 Degrees of Separation series, including 2019’s Breaking the Habit.

The energy transition to a net zero carbon world is an existential challenge for oil and gas majors but US companies are lagging way behind their European rivals in adapting their businesses and minimising their stranded asset risk.

Investor groups call on companies to reflect climate-related risks in financial reporting

Investors are concerned that companies risk overstating financial statements by failing to include the effects of climate change on profits and assets

LONDON – Today, major investor groups from around the world representing assets worth over $103 trillion released an Open Letter on Accounting Standards calling on companies and auditors to fully reflect the effects of climate change in their declared results. In particular they call for compliance with groundbreaking new guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on the pressing need to reflect climate-related risks in financial reports. The letter was signed by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance initiative, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA).

Mark Carney, COP 26 Finance Adviser and UN Special Envoy, commented: “Markets require information to operate effectively – what gets measured gets managed. Investors need to understand how extreme weather events and climate policies to achieve net zero affect business models and what could be the associated financial impact. This requires an improvement in the quantity, quality and comparability of reporting, which, as the IASB has made clear, should be included in the core financial reports issued by companies. As it is increasingly clear that climate change will prompt reassessments of the values of virtually every financial asset, investors have a right to know which companies will be the leaders and the laggards in the climate transition.”

Today, company accounts typically apply business as usual assumptions – for example they place high values on the future price of fossil fuels, and declare a profit on that basis. Yet our planet cannot sustain business as usual.

In the letter, the groups state that companies need to consider material climate change effects in calculating their profits and assets, and in drawing up their accounts more broadly. Investors also insist that the assumptions that companies apply regarding climate change should be consistent with a sustainable world – in other words in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The effects of this change are potentially huge. BP, for example, recently declared a US$16.8 billion loss, as it recognised that the values it had placed on its assets were inconsistent with climate and other considerations. It also began a review of its future capital expenditure. By following the investor groups demands and taking climate-related risks into consideration in making investments, companies should not be able to exaggerate their true value, and risk generating a pool of ‘stranded assets’, which cannot be exploited without irreparable climate damage.

“The world cannot afford business as usual, but that is what too many companies are currently pricing in with regards to climate change risks,” said PRI CEO Fiona Reynolds. “In order for us to invest properly for the long-term, a sustainable future needs to be factored in when calculating any company’s profits and assets. That is what the IASB statement demands – and so do investors.”

The letter calls for the following:

That companies apply the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit, including showing the key assumptions that have been made with regard to climate-related risks

That auditors only sign off on financial statements that are consistent with the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit

That regulators and civil society work with PRI in enforcing and encouraging these actions

That henceforward the assumptions made by companies in preparing financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards be compatible with the Paris Agreement

The investors note that realistic climate assumptions would have major impacts on companies that have understated the effect of climate-related risks. Among the industries most impacted will be those operating in oil and gas, utilities and transportation. In many of these sectors, analysis predicts that other companies will face potential write offs of similar magnitude to those at BP.

Günther Thallinger, Member of the Board of Management Allianz SE and Chair of the Steering Group of the UN-Convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, commented: “Climate risks is one of the largest financial risks and therefore material. This is why climate risks affecting financial values and revenues must be taken into account in the financial disclosure of a company. The financial disclosure is the most powerful instrument when it comes to the quality, completeness and consistency of information.”

Anne Simpson, Interim Managing Investment Director, Board Governance & Sustainability, CalPERS, said: “Accounting rules were invented so that investors can deploy capital understanding the drivers of risk and return. If the accounts do not capture material climate change risk, then we have smoke and mirrors. We need accounting standards that ensure that companies reporting profits reflect the full costs of those profits. For a long-term investor like CalPERS this is critical as those costs can lead to risk of loss and even bankruptcies. The concept of the accounts being true and fair means climate risk cannot be cloaked in green wash. Company accounts should not allow companies to present a green Ponzi scheme for investors. The IASB guidance is vital to ensure stranded assets are not clutched as a life raft by the desperate. This needs to be picked up by US regulators too so that we have global standards to reflect a global risk.

Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, explains: “We face a climate emergency. It’s vitally important that climate change is accurately factored into financial reporting from companies. Guidance from the IASB makes this crystal clear and auditors must ensure they are providing financial markets with information that takes account of climate risk.”

Emma Herd, Chief Executive Officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change, (Australia/New Zealand) said: “Australian and New Zealand investors are already using climate disclosure in their core strategies from engagement to ESG integration, but to date the coverage and quality of disclosure has mostly fallen short of investor needs. Companies need to utilise the best guidance and tools to produce the most robust climate disclosure that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals or risk being discounted in portfolio decisions.”

Rebecca Wright-Mikula, Executive Director of the Asia Investor Group of Climate Change, said: “There has already been significant progress and uptake of climate risk disclosure in many Asian markets, but investors are wanting companies to take the next step and better demonstrate how their understanding of climate change exposure is informing their business strategies and governance. The recent publication on climate risk from International Accounting Standards Board, coupled with the emerging guidance and scenarios from local regulators and central banks, are key pathways for companies to improve their disclosure for investors.”

3	Fuller financial disclosures enable investors to incorporate climate risks into their investment decision making, helping focus investment on those companies that are more likely to thrive in a carbon-constrained future. At the moment, most companies assume business as usual in their financial statements, while at the same time in the annual report recognising that business as usual is something that the planet simply cannot sustain.

The IASB, which sets accounting standards in the bulk of the world, has issued a paper making clear that material climate change risks must be incorporated in IFRS financial reporting. If properly followed it will have profound implications for the way companies are valued and the decisions made by investors.

The PRI, UNEP FI, UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, IIGCC, IGCC and AIGCC in an open letter are supporting the IASB opinion and calling for:

Companies to apply the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit, including showing the key assumptions that have been made with regard to climate-related risks

The assumptions made by companies in preparing financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards be compatible with the Paris Agreement

Auditors sign off financial statements which are consistent with the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit, which include showing the key assumptions that have been made with regard to climate-related risks

Regulators and civil society support the implementation of the IASB opinion

If the investor group letter is followed, the effect would be to discourage companies from investing in projects that are only profitable because they do not pay the cost of the damage they do to the planet. In 2020 we have seen a number of oil companies write down the value of their asset bases, using oil price assumptions that are closer to those that might be consistent with the Paris Agreement. The impact of changing assumptions is shown most recently by BP, which flagged a massive loss of US$16.8 billion because they are moving to adopt more realistic future oil price assumptions.

Others have joined our call. For example the ICAEW, which is the largest professional body of accountants outside the USA, has written about the need to consider climate.

The global auditing standard-setter, the IAASB, has also produced a paper highlighting the ways in which climate change is already embedded within its requirements, the ISAs. This provides important further backing for the investors’ call. Furthermore, the IASB recently reinforced the message of the November 2019 paper through the publication of educational materials which confirm that material climate change issues should already be reflected in IFRS compliant accounts.

As investors, we need this change to be delivered not just by one sector, but across the investment universe. This will happen, but only if companies and their auditors are aware of the importance of the IASB paper.

PRI is asking signatories to individually sign an investor statement to support our continued engagement with the audit industry, accounting bodies and regulators to support the implementation of the IASB opinion. If you are interested in supporting this statement, please contact Joanne.Lewis@unpri.org for further details.

4	Realising the pace and scale of emissions reductions in the NZE2050 would require a far-reaching set of actions going above and beyond the already ambitious measures in the SDS. A large number of unparalleled changes across all parts of the energy sector would need to be realised simultaneously, at a time when the world is trying to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Primary energy demand in the NZE2050 falls by 17% between 2019 and 2030, to a level similar to 2006, even though the global economy is twice as large. Electrification, efficiency gains and behaviour changes are central to achieving this. Coal demand falls by almost 60% over this period to a level last seen in the 1970s.

5	A growing number of governments are setting targets to end their contribution to global warming. Bookmark this page to stay up to date

By Megan Darby and Isabelle Gerretsen

To end dangerous overheating of the planet, humans need to stop putting more greenhouse gases into the air than we take out.

The 2015 Paris Agreement set a global goal (couched in legalese) to reach net zero emissions in the second half of the century.

An increasing number of governments are translating that into national strategy, setting out visions of a carbon-free future. Is it enough? Of course not. But it is becoming the benchmark for leadership on the world stage.

More than a hundred countries have joined an alliance aiming for net zero emissions by 2050. This is aspirational and not always backed by domestic action.

To make Climate Home’s list, the target must be included in a winning political manifesto, government statement, policy paper, climate law, submission to the UN or other nationally determined document.

Here is a handy guide to who is promising what.

This article was last updated on 27 September 2021. As more and more countries set net zero goals, of varying credibility, we don’t have the resources to track them all here. For an interactive map of the latest targets, try zerotracker.net. For more on the origins of the net zero target, read our deep dive

Argentina

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: Argentina raised its climate ambition in an updated plan to the UN in December 2020, pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and cap its 2030 emissions unconditionally at 359 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), 26% lower than the previous cap of 483 Mt, presented in 2016.

Austria

Target date: 2040

Status: Policy position

Notes: A coalition government sworn in January 2020 promised to pursue climate neutrality by 2040 and 100% clean electricity by 2030, underpinned by binding carbon targets. The right wing People’s Party agreed to the goals in partnership with the Green Party.

Brazil

Target date: 2060

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Brazil set an “indicative” goal of carbon neutrality by 2060 in its updated pledge to the Paris Agreement submitted December 2020. However it was not matched by an increase in ambition before 2030 and came as deforestation reached a 12-year high.

Bhutan

Target date: Currently carbon negative and aiming for carbon neutrality as it develops

Status: Pledged towards the Paris Agreement

Notes: With a population of less than a million, on low incomes, surrounded by forests and hydropower resources, Bhutan has an easier task balancing the carbon accounts than most. It has some green policies, but economic growth and rising demand for cars is putting upward pressure on emissions.

Canada

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Justin Trudeau narrowly scraped a second term as prime minister in October 2019, on a platform that centred climate action. The Canadian Senate adopted the net zero emissions accountability act in June 2021, making Canada’s 2050 net zero target official. The law requires successive governments to create carbon targets and a plan to meet them every five years from 2030-2050. Trudeau walked a tightrope on climate and energy policy in his first term, pushing through a carbon tax while defending controversial oil pipelines. He continues to face pressure from leftist and green parties to block the pipelines and from oil-producing provinces to water down climate policy.

Chile

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: President Sebastian Piñera announced the country’s intention to go carbon neutral in June 2019. Santiago was due to host UN climate talks later that year, but cancelled at the last minute due to civil unrest. In April 2020 the government reiterated its long term goal as it submitted a strengthened medium term pledge to the UN. For starters, the country will close eight of its 28 coal power plants by 2024 and phase out the fuel by 2040.

China

Target date: 2060

Status: Statement of intent

Notes: President Xi Jinping announced to the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2020 that China would strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country would adopt “more vigorous policies and measures” to peak emissions before 2030, he added. Beijing has prioritised clean energy in its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, but many provinces are building new coal power plants to boost economic growth.

Colombia

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: By 2030 Colombia will cut its emissions by 51% compared to business as usual, the country pledged in its submission to the UN in December 2020. The new target is a huge jump from the previous pledge which was a 20% of emissions reduction compared with business as usual by 2030. By 2050 the country aims to be carbon neutral.

Costa Rica

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Previous administrations said Costa Rica would be carbon neutral by 2021, which is… not happening. In February 2019, president Carlos Alvarado Quesada set out a climate policy package. A long term strategy submitted to the UN in December confirmed net zero emissions as the 2050 goal. The country is routinely celebrated for getting nearly all its electricity from renewables – primarily hydropower – but citizens still rely on petrol and diesel to get around. An e-mobility decree adopted in 2018 aims to change that.

Denmark

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: The government set out plans in 2018 to build a “climate-neutral society” by 2050. Its package included a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and support for electric vehicles. Climate change was a major theme in June 2019 parliamentary elections and the victorious “red bloc” parties enshrined tougher emissions targets in legislation passed six months later.

European Union

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: The European Commission is working towards a bloc-wide 2050 net zero emissions target, under a “Green Deal” published in December 2019. It was endorsed by the European Council of national leaders the same month, with Poland the only dissenting voice, refusing to commit to its implementation. The long term strategy was presented to the UN in March 2020.

Fiji

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: As president of Cop23, the UN climate summit in 2017, Fiji made an extra effort to show leadership. In 2018, the Pacific island state submitted a plan to the UN with the goal of net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy. Its “very high ambition” scenario even goes carbon negative, but this is contingent on new technologies and international support. In December 2020, Fiji said it aims to slash emissions 30% by 2030, compared to 2013.

Finland

Target date: 2035

Status: Coalition agreement

Notes: Five political parties agreed in June 2019 to strengthen the country’s climate law, as part of negotiations to form a government. The target is expected to require curbs on industrial logging and a phaseout of peat burning for power generation.

France

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: French lawmakers voted a net zero target into law on 27 June 2019, the same day as the UK. Other parts of the government’s proposed climate and energy package remained to be agreed. Controversially, it proposed postponing nuclear power plant closures. In its first report in June, the newly established High Council for the Climate advised France must triple the pace of emissions reductions to meet the carbon neutrality goal.

Germany

Target date: 2045

Status: In law

Notes: Germany enshrined its 2045 net zero target in law in June 2021, after raising its climate ambition following a landmark court ruling the previous month. The cabinet adopted a 65% emissions reduction by 2030, 85-90% by 2040 and net zero emissions by 2045, all compared to 1990 levels. The previous targets were 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve the goals, analysts say Germany must phase out coal by 2030, speed up the transition to electric mobility and increase the carbon price on transport and heating fuel.

Grenada

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: The small island nation has committed to reducing its emissions by 40% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, and net zero by 2050.

Hungary

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Hungary committed to climate neutrality by 2050 in a 3-page climate law passed in June 2020. That was not backed up by a strengthened 2030 emissions-cutting target, however, putting off the heavy lifting to next decade. The country is set to close its last coal power plant by 2025 and build new nuclear capacity, with Russia’s help.

Iceland

Target date: 2040

Status: Policy position

Notes: The strategy unveiled in 2018 focuses on phasing fossil fuels out of the transport sector, tree-planting and restoring wetlands. Iceland already has virtually carbon-free electricity and heating from geothermal and hydroelectric sources.

Ireland

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Ireland’s coalition government passed its climate law in July 2021 that enshrines emissions reduction targets in law and puts the country on a path to carbon neutrality by 2050. The government agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by an average 7% per year and 51% between 2018 and 2030, in line with Paris Agreement commitments. Sectors such as transport and agriculture will require significant reform if they are to halve their emissions by 2030.

Japan

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Japan enshrined its 2050 net zero target in law in May 2021. Japan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter and relies on coal for a third of its electricity generation. The net zero target requires significant investment in renewables and a complete overhaul of the country’s existing climate strategy which focuses heavily on coal power.

Maldives

Target date: 2030

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: The Maldives is aiming for net zero emissions by 2030, but this ambitious target is only attainable with significant financial support. The small, low-lying island state is already suffering severe climate impacts such as storm surges and coastal erosion.

Laos

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In its submission to the UN in May 2021, Laos said it is aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and reduce emissions by 60% from business as usual by 2030 – around 62Mt CO2. Agriculture is the biggest driver of emissions in the southeast Asian nation. Mitigation measures include expanding forest cover to 70% of land area by 2030 and rapidly ramping up renewables.

Marshall Islands

Target date: 2050

Status: Pledged towards the Paris Agreement

Notes: The low-lying island nation is acutely vulnerable to sea level rise and keen to set an example on decarbonisation. Its updated submission to the UN in September 2018 set out an aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050, albeit without concrete policies to get all the way. Depending on the availability of international support, the plan identified measures to cut emissions 56-87% from 2010 levels.

Nepal

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In December 2020, Nepal said in its national submission to the UN that it aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, by investing more in renewables, electric transport and reforestation. Nepal’s carbon emissions per capita are among the lowest in the world, but the country is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Himalayan glaciers in Nepal have been losing almost half a metre of ice each year since the start of the century and floods and landslides are common.

New Zealand

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Unusually for a developed country, New Zealand’s biggest source of emissions is farming. A law passed in November 2019 sets a net zero goal for all greenhouse gases except biogenic methane (mostly from sheep and cattle), which is to be cut 24-47% from 2017 levels by 2050. It remains contentious with the meat lobby, which argues New Zealand will lose market share to countries with less stringent sustainability standards.

Norway

Target date: 2030/2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: Norway was among the first parliaments in the world to discuss climate neutrality, with lawmakers agreeing to aim for 2050 domestically and 2030 with international offsets. This was a signal of intent, not a binding climate law. The country benefits from abundant hydropower resources and has aggressive policies to electrify road transport, yet the government continues to back controversial Arctic oil drilling.

Panama

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: Panama has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050. Panama plans to restore 50,000 hectares of national forests, which will contribute to absorbing around 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions by 2050, according to the NDC partnership.

Portugal

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: Portugal launched a roadmap in December 2018 for getting to net zero, outlining strategies for energy, transport, waste, farming and forests. It is one of the member states calling for the EU to adopt a 2050 net zero target.

Singapore

Target date: “As soon as viable in the second half of the century”

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Like Japan, Singapore has avoided committing to a firm date for decarbonisation, but cited it as the ultimate goal of a long term strategy submitted to the UN in March 2020. Internal combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out by 2040, in favour of electric vehicles, but the island state said its clean energy potential was limited by a lack of space for solar panels.

Slovakia

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: One of the first EU member states to formally submit a long term strategy to the UN, Slovakia said it was aiming for “climate neutrality” in 2050. However the document focused on policies out to 2030 and noted further measures would need to be developed to meet the target.

South Africa

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: The government unveiled its Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) in September 2020, outlining its aim of becoming a net zero economy by 2050. However, the energy plan cited in the strategy still sees South Africa burning coal on this date. Currently over 90% of the country’s electricity is generated from coal and the country is building coal plants as well as supporting investment in renewables.

South Korea

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: South Korean president Moon Jae-in formally committed to a 2050 net zero target in October 2020, turning an election promise into a policy pledge. This was later confirmed in a submission to the UN. After his Democratic Party won a landslide victory in April 2020, Moon declared that he would push ahead with his manifesto promise of a Green New Deal to decarbonise the economy by 2050 and end coal financing. It is a big deal for the 7th highest national CO2 emitter. South Korea gets over 40% of its electricity from coal and has been a major financier of overseas coal projects.

Spain

Target date: 2050

Status: Draft law

Notes: The government presented its draft climate framework bill to parliament in May 2020, as the country started to loosen restrictions on movement to halt the spread of coronavirus. Originally intended to create a long term framework for cutting emissions, the law doubles as a blueprint for economic recovery from Covid-19, said vice president Teresa Ribera. It sets interim targets for 2030, establishes a commission to monitor progress and bans new coal, oil and gas exploration licences with immediate effect.

Sweden

Target date: 2045

Status: In law

Notes: Sweden legislated its net zero target in 2017, bringing forward its timeline for carbon neutrality by five years in response to the Paris Agreement. It got extra attention in contrast with Donald Trump’s move to withdraw the US from the pact. At least 85% of the emissions cuts are to be achieved through domestic policies, leaving the door open for international credits to make up the rest.

Switzerland

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In its national submission to the UN in December 2020, Switzerland announced its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, deepening its target under the Paris Agreement of a 70-85% emission reduction. In 2015, the small land-locked country was the first in the world to submit its formal emissions reduction plan for 2030 to the UN. The country’s climate strategy includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the air – the mountainous country hosts some of the most advanced projects in this field – and investing in renewables.

Turkey

Target date: 2053

Status: Policy position

Notes: In October 2021, the Turkish cabinet approved a net zero goal of 2053 – the 130th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. At that time, the government intended to begin discussions on a pathway towards the 2053 target in early 2022. Turkey’s emissions are dominated by energy, particularly coal.

Ukraine

Target date: 2060

Status: Policy position

Notes: In Ukraine’s 2030 economic strategy in March 2021, the country outlined its plans to achieve carbon neutrality “no later than 2060.” Under current plans, Ukraine is only on track to reach net zero emissions by 2070, according to Climate Action Tracker. The country will need to accelerate its deployment of renewable energy and bring forward its 2050 coal phase-out date if it is to meet its 2060 target.

United Kingdom

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: The UK already passed a framework law for cutting emissions in 2008, so setting a net zero target is as simple as replacing 80% with 100%. Parliament passed the amendment on 27 June 2019. Meeting the goal is tougher and the independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has emphasised more policies will be needed across sectors to give it life.

Scotland’s devolved parliament is working on a bill to reach net zero in 2045, based on its strong renewable energy resources and capacity to store CO2 in depleted North Sea oilfields. It is expected to pass into law by autumn 2019.

The CCC advised Wales would have a harder job and 95% emissions cuts by 2050 was feasible. The Welsh government accepted the recommendation and expressed an ambition to go further to net zero.

United States of America

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In its submission to the UN, the US said in April 2021 that it would reduce its emissions by 50-52% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and achieve net zero emissions, no later than 2050. When he was elected president of the US in November 2020 Joe Biden promised a $2 trillion “clean energy revolution” and 100% clean electricity by 2035, but opposition from Republicans and conservative Democrats led to him significantly watering down climate spending in a $1.2 trillion bipartisan package.

Uruguay

Target date: 2030

Status: Contribution to the Paris Agreement

Notes: This is more of a forecast than a commitment, based on Uruguay’s anomalous trend of increasing forest cover. Combined with policies to reduce emissions from beef farming, waste and energy, this is expected to make the country a net carbon sink by 2030, according to its national submission to the UN pact.

6	A Climate Transition Forecasting Consortium

What is IPR

The Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) aims to prepare institutional investors for the portfolio risks and opportunities associated with a forecast acceleration of policy responses to climate change. IPR contends that governments will be forced to act more decisively than they have thus far, leaving financial portfolios exposed to significant transition risk.

Commissioned by PRI in 2018, IPR is led by Vivid Economics and Energy Transition Advisors (ETA). Combined with Research Partners and investor Strategic Partners, this forms the IPR Climate Transition Forecasting Consortium.

What is IPR?

Acceleration, Ratchets and Implications for Investors

Government action to tackle climate change remains insufficient to achieve the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Yet as the realities of climate change become increasingly apparent, it is inevitable that governments at national and international levels will be forced to act more decisively than they have so far.

IPR forecasts general acceleration in policy responses to 2025, driven in part by continuing pressure for change, increasingly evident at multilateral fora and again at COP 26 and expected at the 2023 Stocktake and the 2025 Ratchet.

Disorderly Transition

IPR assesses that those policy responses will increasingly be forceful, abrupt, and disorderly leaving financial portfolios exposed to significant transition risk.

To help prepare markets and institutional investors for the impacts of this policy acceleration and a disorderly transition IPR models in detail the impact of the forecasted policies on the energy system, food & land use system and real economy.

This acceleration and general implications for investors is set out in the in the Forecast Policy Scenario (FPS).

IPR has also published a new 1.5C Required Policy Scenario (RPS) outlining the more ambitious policies that would be required to reach a 1.5C outcome.

Ratchet pressures increase the likelihood that governments will strengthen policy by 2025 and again to 2030

Paris Ratchet process triggers a cumulating policy response into 2025

The Forecast Policy Scenario (FPS)

Built by Vivid Economics and Energy Transition Advisors, the 2021 Forecast Policy Scenario (FPS) lays out the major climate policies that are likely to be implemented in the 2020’s and quantifies the impact of this response on the real economy and various sectors.

IPR publishes detailed modelling of the impact of policy acceleration:

On key sectors, regions;

On the implications for energy, land use; and

On the macroeconomy

Investors should act now to protect and enhance value by assessing the implications of the IPR Forecast for investment beliefs, portfolio risk and identification of opportunities.

The greater the delay in responding, the greater the potential cost.

IPR’s Forcast Policy Scenario (FPS) value data

What makes the IPR FPS unique?

The FPS provides investors with a unique tool for navigating a complex, evolving policy and regulatory landscape – to enhance portfolio resilience and inform strategic asset allocation.

The FPS:

Provides a realistic outline of the coming policy response through the 2020’s and quantifies the financial risks that it presents

Is based on working up from what policy and technology developments are most likely to emerge, rather than working backwards from pre-defined target temperatures

Focused on a timeframe that is relevant to investors

Models the interaction between impacts of the macro economy, the energy system and the land use system

Provides a granular analysis that breaks down the impact at the regional, sector and – for the first time – asset level

Our forecast of an Inevitable Policy Response provides an alternative to the IEA STEPS as a business planning case for investors, corporates & regulators to consider

IPR range of applications

The 2021 Forecast Policy Scenario (FPS) is IPR’s current assessment of what is anticipated to happen, in terms of future policy developments and the subsequent impact on emissions reduction and temperature outcomes. If all the forecast acceleration in policy and execution takes place the 2021 FPS assesses a 50% probability of holding temperature increase to 1.8C.

Pressure, stocktakes and ratchets

As discussed in our March 2021 Policy Acceleration paper, governments have been moving faster in the last 18 months. The November COP 26 in Glasgow has added momentum to policy announcements.

But a significant gap remains between potential emissions reduction impacts and holding temperature increase to 1.5C. Future policy responses will be needed to address this gap.

Pressure for policy action will continue to increase and come from all angles – environmental, social, and economic - fuelled by fears over national security; enabled by advances in technology and upward pressure by civil society, leading investor groups and businesses to act.

Far more so than in the past, these triggers for action are aligning actors in a common direction.

At the same time, the Paris Agreement ‘ratchet mechanism’ – boosted by outcomes in Glasgow around nations reviewing 2030 targets and subject to the scheduled Stocktake in 2023 and 2025 Ratchet, will increase the likelihood that policy announcements to tackle climate change will accelerate through to 2025. This is the focus of the 2021 FPS.

Forecasting the acceleration: Higher ambition- eight key policy levers

IPR has forecast higher ambition across eight policy levers to secure an accelerated and just transition. Multiple announcements at sub national, national and international levels through 2021 and at COP26 at reflect this higher ambition.

Carbon pricing Carbon taxes

Emissions trading systems

Border carbon adjustments Coal phase-out Prohibiting regulations

Emissions performance standards

Electricity market reforms 100% clean power 100% clean power targets

Renewables capacity auctions and other support policies Zero emission vehicles 100% zero emission vehicle (ZEV) sales legislation

Manufacturer ZEV obligations

ZEV consumer subsidies Low-carbon buildings Prohibiting regulations for fossil heating systems

Purchase subsidies for low-carbon heating systems

Thermal efficiency regulations for new build and retrofit

Minimum energy performance standards for new appliances Clean industry Emissions performance standards for industrial plant

Subsidy for new or retrofit clean industrial process Low-emissions agriculture Methane or nitrous oxide emissions tax or cap-and-trade system

Subsidy for low-emissions agricultural practices and technologies

Farmer education and technical assistance programmes Forestry Strong policy action against deforestation, such as monitoring and penalties, supported by consumer pressure

Incentives for reforestation and afforestation via domestic action and carbon markets

‘Just Transition’ lens to ensure social and political feasibility

Forecasting the acceleration: Top 10 forecasts of where the impact will be felt

IPR analyses in detail the policies we expect to see implemented and where they will have impact.

They include bans on coal, and on internal combustion engines; an increase in nuclear capacity and bioenergy crops; greater effort on energy efficiency and re/afforestation; wider use of carbon pricing including Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM) and increasing the supply of low-cost capital to green economy projects.

Carbon pricing 1. Carbon Border Adjustments Mechanisms (CBAMs) for carbon will become increasingly a policy option. This could lead the United States to announce a national carbon pricing system by 2025 and signal a strong carbon price path to reach a backstop of $65 by 2030. 2. The European Union’s evolving commitments will deliver substantial carbon prices. By 2030, we expect EU policy to backstop an EU ETS carbon price of $75/tCO2 to ensure long-term action toward decarbonization in heavy emitting sectors. Coal 3. In India, rapidly evolving Indian policy and prospects for market reforms and pricing has already ended further investment in new coal. 4. China will end construction of new coal fired power production after 2025, driven by new policies to facilitate its 2060 net zero target, geopolitical trends and risk considerations* 5. The United States will end all coal-fired power generation by 2035, through a combination of emission performance standards and carbon pricing at the Federal and State levels, combined with market forces. Clean power 6. The United States will implement a binding and credible 100% clean power standard for 2040 ending unabated fossil electricity generation. Zero emission vehicles 7. China, France, Germany, Italy and Korea will end the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans in 2035. Jointly these large markets will accelerate the auto industry transition to electric drive, and precipitate further policy action internationally. Industry 8. All major industrial economies including the US, Germany, Japan and China will require all new industrial plants, led by steel and cement, to be low-carbon by 2040, through a combination of emissions performance standards and carbon pricing. Agriculture 9. The US, Canada, Australia and other major agricultural producers will have comprehensive mitigation policy in place by 2025 to reduce emissions from production of crops and livestock. Land use 10. Major tropical forest countries will end deforestation by 2035, with domestic policy responding to international climate finance and corporate supply chain pressures.

Closing the gap to 1.5C: The Required Policy Scenario (RPS)

Even with this rapid transformation, the forecasted changes in the FPS would not yet be enough to keep warming to 1.5C – the temperature scientists have shown to be critical to avoiding the worst impacts and most costly effects of climate change.

To bolster policy advocacy around the world and help prepare the $90 trillion of banks and investors committed to align with net zero by 2050 ambition, the IPR has developed the new 1.5C Required Policy Scenario (RPS).

IPR 1.5°C RSP:Summary

The 1.5°C RPS details future policy developments needed to accelerate emissions reduction and hold global temperature increase to a 1.5 °C outcome Despite rapid transformation, the IPR FPS 2021 changes would still not be enough to hold warming to 1.5°C with Net Zero in 2050, which requires greater action, sooner. Key actions to pursue a 1.5°C outcome include: A rapid end to deforestation across the entire globe, ideally by 2025 and before 2030. If not, the energy system has to absorb greater reductions, potentially through bioenergy with CCS (BECCS)

Crucially, unabated coal fully decommissioned in most advanced economies including China by 2035

Phase out new fossil cars in almost all markets by 2040 and transition to 100% clean power globally by 2045

The 2021 1.5C RPS calls for much more ambitious policy action over and above what is forecast. The 1.5C RPS specifically targets a 1.5C outcome and reflects the policy gap between the FPS forecasts of what will happen and the level of policy change required to hold temperature increase at a 1.5C outcome.

The 1.5C RPS is comparable to the IEA Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario, but by deepening the analysis of the food and land systems provides the first roadmap of policies needed across both the energy and land use systems to hold temperature increases to 1.5C.

In the FPS, rising carbon prices play a key role in driving change through the economy. But analysis suggests it would not be politically feasible to drive carbon markets and carbon pricing further, and rapidly enough to achieve the required shift.

Accordingly, to push for 1.5C, governments around the globe would need to pursue immediate policy action which directly intervenes in markets to set performance standards, including strict bans, to drive a step change in the energy system:

Phase out new fossil cars in almost all markets by 2040.

Transition to 100% clean power globally by 2045.

Eliminate unabated coal in most advanced economies including China by 2035.

The 2021 1.5C Required Policy Scenario (RPS) is IPR’s current assessment of future policy developments needed to accelerate emissions reduction and hold global temperature increase to a 1.5 Degree outcome.

Looking ahead: NETS in 2030s?

Failure to pursue significant policy changes within the next two to three years would leave a significant ramping up of Negative Emissions Technologies (NETS) in the 2030s as a potential alternative to keep warming to 1.5C.

But given food and land use constraints, and the fact that many technologies are unproven at scale, pushing beyond the already forecasted acceleration in Nature Based Solutions (NBS) would also require significant and urgent policy support.

IPR Investor Value Drivers Database- Support for risk, valuation and transition models

The IPR Investor Value Drivers Database encompasses all FPS variables by region annually, up to 2050, incorporating a total of 300,000 thousand data points.

It provides a direct input into the core valuation and risk models that drive investor decisions and assistance to those investors working towards integrating climate scenarios into their investment strategies.

The database enables asset managers and service providers to incorporate the IPR forecast policy scenarios and underlying short and long term data directly into their valuation models and utilise them as a basis for assessing existing investment beliefs, and determining strategic asset allocation, portfolio construction and corporate engagement strategies.

The database is open source and available as a resource for investor, policy makers and regulators.

Supporting investor action to protect and enhance value

The PRI encourages signatories to engage in forward looking analysis and strategic planning to better prepare for transition and mitigate financial losses associated with an accelerated policy response.

Careful attention is recommended for strategic asset allocation, portfolio structure, governance approaches, and risk management responses.

Specific actions include:

Creating governance / board approval of IPR as part of the ‘house view’ of climate transition

Preparing for a more ‘active’ stance in portfolio construction around the transition theme

Embedding aspects of IPR forecasts into asset manager mandates with associated changes to mandate incentives

Encouraging asset managers to build products around IPR forecasts

Placing IPR as a core reference standard in ongoing TCFD disclosures

Requesting asset consultants to build IPR into SAA and portfolio construction

Requesting credit ratings agencies to incorporate IPR into assessments

Use of IPR as a reference standard in stewardship activities and company engagement

Lobbying policymakers on the inevitability of IPR scenarios to encourage early action

7	About this report

The World Energy Outlook, the IEA’s flagship publication, provides a comprehensive view of how the global energy system could develop in the coming decades. This year’s exceptional circumstances require an exceptional approach. The usual long-term modelling horizons are kept but the focus for the World Energy Outlook 2020 is firmly on the next 10 years, exploring in detail the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the energy sector, and the near-term actions that could accelerate clean energy transitions.



The analysis targets the key uncertainties facing the energy sector in relation to the duration of the pandemic and its implications, while mapping out the choices that would pave the way towards a sustainable recovery. The strategic insights from the WEO-2020 are based on detailed modelling of different potential pathways out of the crisis, covering all regions, fuels and technologies and using the latest data on energy markets, policies and costs.

8	The five largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies in the world have invested over $1 billion in shareholder funds in the three years following the Paris climate agreement on “misleading climate-related branding and lobbying,” according to a new report from InfluenceMap.

The research, released last Friday, found that the five companies — ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and Total — spend $200 million dollars every year on lobbying seeking to control, delay or block policies that combat climate change.

{mosads}“These efforts are overwhelmingly in conflict with the goals of this landmark global climate accord, and designed to maintain the social and legal license to operate and expand fossil fuel operations,” the report states.

The report found that Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil led the other companies in lobbying efforts pushing back against legislation intended to tackle global warming.

The report also found that the companies were increasingly using social media to push their agenda to oppose such polices. Top oil companies and their industry bodies also were found to have spent $2 million on ads ran on Facebook and Instagram that promoted the benefits of increased fossil fuel production, according the report.

Because company disclosures on spending on climate lobbying are limited, the UK-based nonprofit said it created the report using a methodology that focused on the best available records and intensive research of corporate messaging “to evaluate oil major spending aimed at influencing the climate agenda, both directly and through their key trade groups.”

The nonprofit’s research also found that companies spent an annual $195 million on investing in branding campaigns “aimed at convincing stakeholders they are on board with ambitious action on climate.”

The report pointed to ExxonMobil’s current promotion of its algae-biofuels research and the jointly funded Oil and Gas Climate Initiative as an example. The nonprofit said the messaging of the company’s promotion “de-emphasizes climate regulation while stressing voluntary action and low carbon investments.”

“In fact, company disclosures show such investments will make around 3% of the oil projected capital investments by the oil majors,” the report states. “Exxon’s goal of reaching 10,000 barrels of biofuel a day by 2025 would still only equate to 0.2% of its current refinery capacity, essentially a rounding error.”

Shell rejected the report’s findings in a statement to The Guardian: “We firmly reject the premise of this report. We are very clear about our support for the Paris agreement, and the steps that we are taking to help meet society’s needs for more and cleaner energy.

“We make no apology for talking to policymakers and regulators around the world to make our voice heard on crucial topics such as climate change and how to address it,” the company added.

Chevron also came out against the report, telling the news agency that it “is taking prudent, cost-effective actions and is committed to working with policymakers to design balanced and transparent greenhouse gas emissions reductions policies that address environmental goals and ensure consumers have access to affordable, reliable and ever cleaner energy.”	[{"start": 0, "end": 274, "text": "The

9	LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Tuesday became the first major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave a leading U.S. refining lobby due to disagreement on climate policies, citing its support for the goals of the Paris climate agreement.

In its first review of its association with 19 key industry groups, Shell said it had found “material misalignment” over climate policy with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and would quit the body in 2020.

The review is part of Shell’s drive to increase transparency and show investors it is in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement’s goals to limit global warming by reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by the end of the century.

It is the latest sign of how investor pressure on oil companies, particularly in Europe, is leading to changes in their behavior around climate. Last year, Shell caved in to investor pressure over climate change, setting out plans to introduce industry-leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay.

Its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, has since repeatedly urged oil and gas producers to take action over climate and pollution, staking out a more radical position than the heads of other major oil companies.

“AFPM has not stated support for the goal of the Paris Agreement. Shell supports the goal of the Paris Agreement,” the Anglo-Dutch company said in its decision.

“The need for urgent action in response to climate change has become ever more obvious since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. As a result, society’s expectations in this area have changed, and Shell’s views have also evolved,” van Beurden said in the report.

The company has disagreed with AFPM on a number of issues for some time, according to two lobbying sources. Shell said it also disagreed with AFPM’s opposition to a price on carbon and action on low-carbon technologies.

Shell and AFPM have also been at odds in recent months over regulation over the use of renewable fuels. While Shell and other large refiners invested in cleaner fuel technology, AFPM has fought hard against standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidize the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool - saying it hurts independent refiners.

Shell and rivals Exxon and BP have in recent years left the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative political group, over its stance on climate change.

AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson thanked Shell for its “longstanding collaboration.”

“We will also continue working on behalf of the refining and petrochemical industries to advance policies that ensure reliable and affordable access to fuels and petrochemicals, while being responsible stewards of the environment,” Thompson said in a statement.

AFPM counts around 300 U.S. and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Total SA that operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, according to its 2018 annual report.

French oil major Total said in a statement to Reuters that consensus required by organizations such as AFPM does not always reflect its position, and that it regularly monitors the relevance of its participation.

“In this case, Total takes a pro-active approach in order to convince its peers, particularly on climate issues. In case of differing points of view, Total publicly defends its position, and is ready to reconsider its participation in case of disagreement,” the company said.

Total said it was fully aware of climate issues, has publicly recognized them and takes them into its strategy.

Shell’s review was welcomed by Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, which invests in Shell and led discussions with the company over its climate policy.

“This is an industry first,” Matthews said. “With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within oil and gas but across all industries. The challenge now is for others to follow suit.”

WALK AWAY

Shell also found “some” misalignment with nine other trade associations, including the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s main lobby.

Shell said that while it had some climate-related differences with the API, it welcomed the lobby’s advocacy on a range of state and federal issues such as trade and transport, as well as the API’s efforts to reduce methane emissions.

Shell said it will continue to engage with the API and other groups over climate policies and monitor their alignment.

Shell last month urged President Donald Trump’s administration to tighten restrictions on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, instead of weakening them as planned.
