0":0,"text":"WHEREAS: We, the shareholders, must protect our assets against devastating climate change, and we therefore support companies to substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company to substantially reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their energy products (Scope 3) in the medium- and long- term future, as defined by the Company.\n\nTo allow maximum flexibility, nothing in this resolution shall serve to micromanage the Company by seeking to impose methods for implementing complex policies in place of the ongoing judgement of management as overseen by its board of directors.\n\nYou have our support.\nThe policies of the energy industry are crucial to curbing climate change. Therefore, shareholders support oil and gas companies to change course; to substantially reduce emissions.\n\nFiduciary duty\n\nAs shareholders, we understand this support to be part of our fiduciary duty to protect all assets in the global economy from devastating climate change. Climate-related risks are a source of financial risk, and therefore limiting global warming is essential to risk management and responsible stewardship of the economy.\n\nWe therefore support the Company to reduce the emissions of their energy products (Scope 3). Reducing emissions from the use of energy products is essential to limiting global warming.\n\nAn increasing number of investors insist on reductions of all emissions\n\nShell, BP, Equinor, and Total have already adopted Scope 3 ambitions. Backing from investors that insist on reductions of\n\nall emissions continues to gain momentum; in 2020, an unprecedented number of shareholders voted for climate resolutions. It is evident that a growing group of investors across the energy sector is uniting behind visible and unambiguous support for reductions of all emissions.\n\nNothing in this resolution shall limit the Companys powers to set and vary their strategy or take any action which they believe in good faith would best contribute to reducing GHG emissions.\n\nWe believe that the Company could lead and thrive in the energy transition. We therefore encourage you to reduce emissions, inspiring society, employees, shareholders, and the energy sector, and allowing the company to meet an increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions to levels consistent with curbing climate change.\n\nYou have our support.\n\n Chevron shares the view that managing climate change-related risks and energy transition opportunities is vital to delivering superior long-term value. Chevron is taking actions that support a global approach to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible for society.\n\nChevron has established Scope 1 and Scope 2 metrics for Upstream oil, gas, flaring and methane and believes that the most appropriate approach for measuring the emissions performance of an Upstream asset is greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity by commodity on an equity basis. This approach ensures Chevron is accountable for all Upstream GHG emissions, irrespective of who is the operator, unlike many others who account only for emissions from a subset of assets in which they have invested. Consistent with the timing of the global stock-takes under the Paris Agreement, Chevron has set metrics for 2023 and 2028 and intends to do so every five years thereafter. Successfully achieving these emissions intensity reduction metrics is linked to most Chevron employees variable compensation, as reflected in the Chevron Incentive Plan (CIP) scorecard. Below is a table of the Companys adopted metrics:\n\nThe Company leverages its capabilities, assets, and expertise to focus on these three action areas that aim to deliver measurable progress: (1) lower carbon intensity cost efficiently, (2) increase renewables and offsets in support of our own business, and (3) invest in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions. Chevron believes the worlds continued demand for oil and gas should be supplied by the cleanest and most efficient producers. Chevron addresses Scope 3 emissions by taking the following actions:\n\n \n\n \t1.\t\nSupporting a price on carbon through well-designed policies;\n\n \n\n \t2.\t\nTransparently reporting Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products; and\n\n \n\n \t3.\t\nEnabling customers to lower their emissions through increasing our renewable products, offering offsets, and investing in low-carbon technologies.\n\nThese contributions support a global approach to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible for society.\n\nChevron also prioritizes the most cost efficient and effective emissions reductions - an approach that is good for stockholders and good for society. Through 2028, Chevron plans to spend approximately $2 billion in carbon reduction projects. Further, Chevron has increased renewable fuels and products in its value chains over the last decade and plans to spend $750 million by 2028 in investments in renewables and offsets. Chevron also recently increased its commitment to invest in low-carbon technologies that address Scope 3 emissions, such as carbon capture utilization and storage and lower carbon energies by committing $300 million to the Future Energy Fund II.\n\nChevrons employees are proud of their role in providing affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy that people around the world depend on every day.\n\nYour Board believes that Chevrons actions and reporting are appropriate and that the Companys strategy and method for setting emissions intensity reduction metrics effectively position Chevron to address future opportunities and risks. The Companys strategies, such as those outlined above, are intended to drive higher returns and lower carbon."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-12T01:05:46.700117Z","updated_at":"2023-03-26T18:22:30.463019Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":10,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":230,"annotations":[{"id":10,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":35,"end":49,"text":"Carbon

by failing to include the effects of climate change on profits and assets\n\nLONDON – Today, major investor groups from around the world representing assets worth over $103 trillion released an Open Letter on Accounting Standards calling on companies and auditors to fully reflect the effects of climate change in their declared results. In particular they call for compliance with groundbreaking new guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on the pressing need to reflect climate-related risks in financial reports. The letter was signed by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance initiative, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA).\n\nMark Carney, COP 26 Finance Adviser and UN Special Envoy, commented: “Markets require information to operate effectively – what gets measured gets managed. Investors need to understand how extreme weather events and climate policies to achieve net zero affect business models and what could be the associated financial impact. This requires an improvement in the quantity, quality and comparability of reporting, which, as the IASB has made clear, should be included in the core financial reports issued by companies. As it is increasingly clear that climate change will prompt reassessments of the values of virtually every financial asset, investors have a right to know which companies will be the leaders and the laggards in the climate transition.”\n\nToday, company accounts typically apply business as usual assumptions – for example they place high values on the future price of fossil fuels, and declare a profit on that basis. Yet our planet cannot sustain business as usual.\n\nIn the letter, the groups state that companies need to consider material climate change effects in calculating their profits and assets, and in drawing up their accounts more broadly. Investors also insist that the assumptions that companies apply regarding climate change should be consistent with a sustainable world – in other words in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe effects of this change are potentially huge. BP, for example, recently declared a US$16.8 billion loss, as it recognised that the values it had placed on its assets were inconsistent with climate and other considerations. It also began a review of its future capital expenditure. By following the investor groups demands and taking climate-related risks into consideration in making investments, companies should not be able to exaggerate their true value, and risk generating a pool of ‘stranded assets’, which cannot be exploited without irreparable climate damage.\n\n“The world cannot afford business as usual, but that is what too many companies are currently pricing in with regards to climate change risks,” said PRI CEO Fiona Reynolds. “In order for us to invest properly for the long-term, a sustainable future needs to be factored in when calculating any company’s profits and assets. That is what the IASB statement demands – and so do investors.”\n\nThe letter calls for the following:\n\nThat companies apply the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit, including showing the key assumptions that have been made with regard to climate-related risks\n\nThat auditors only sign off on financial statements that are consistent with the IASB opinion in the letter and the spirit\n\nThat regulators and civil society work with PRI in enforcing and encouraging these actions\n\nThat henceforward the assumptions made by companies in preparing financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards be compatible with the Paris Agreement\n\nThe investors note that realistic climate assumptions would have major impacts on companies that have understated the effect of climate-related risks. Among the industries most impacted will be those operating in oil and gas, utilities and transportation. In many of these sectors, analysis predicts that other companies will face potential write offs of similar magnitude to those at BP.\n\nGünther Thallinger, Member of the Board of Management Allianz SE and Chair of the Steering Group of the UN-Convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, commented: “Climate risks is one of the largest financial risks and therefore material. This is why climate risks affecting financial values and revenues must be taken into account in the financial disclosure of a company. The financial disclosure is the most powerful instrument when it comes to the quality, completeness and consistency of information.”\n\nAnne Simpson, Interim Managing Investment Director, Board Governance & Sustainability, CalPERS, said: “Accounting rules were invented so that investors can deploy capital understanding the drivers of risk and return. If the accounts do not capture material climate change risk, then we have smoke and mirrors. We need accounting standards that ensure that companies reporting profits reflect the full costs of those profits. For a long-term investor like CalPERS this is critical as those costs can lead to risk of loss and even bankruptcies. The concept of the accounts being true and fair means climate risk cannot be cloaked in green wash. Company accounts should not allow companies to present a green Ponzi scheme for investors. The IASB guidance is vital to ensure stranded assets are not clutched as a life raft by the desperate. This needs to be picked up by US regulators too so that we have global standards to reflect a global risk.\n\nStephanie Pfeifer, CEO, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, explains: “We face a climate emergency. It’s vitally important that climate change is accurately factored into financial reporting from companies. Guidance from the IASB makes this crystal clear and auditors must ensure they are providing financial markets with information that takes account of climate risk.”\n\nEmma Herd, Chief Executive Officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change, (Australia\/New Zealand) said: “Australian and New Zealand investors are already using climate disclosure in their core strategies from engagement to ESG integration, but to date the coverage and quality of disclosure has mostly fallen short of investor needs. Companies need to utilise the best guidance and tools to produce the most robust climate disclosure that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals or risk being discounted in portfolio decisions.”\n\nRebecca Wright-Mikula, Executive Director of the Asia Investor Group of Climate Change, said: “There has already been significant progress and uptake of climate risk disclosure in many Asian markets, but investors are wanting companies to take the next step and better demonstrate how their understanding of climate change exposure is informing their business strategies and governance. The recent publication on climate risk from International Accounting Standards Board, coupled with the emerging guidance and scenarios from local regulators and central banks, are key pathways for companies to improve their disclosure for investors.”\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nTom Fern, Head of Communications, IIGCC\n\nE-mail: tfern@IIGCC.org\n\nMobile: +44 (0) 7867 360 273\n\nAbout IIGCC\n\nThe Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) is the European membership body for investor collaboration on climate change and the voice of investors taking action for a prosperous, low-carbon future.
